      <description>I noticed that most people think Vim sucks and they constantly perform the following keystrokes
:wq perl somefile.pl vim somefile.pl Here is the first trick, you do not need to exit vim to perform a command. Simply type the following while you are in vim
:!perl somefile.pl Offcourse, you do not want to type the filename all the time, so you use the following
:!perl % Now, if you are using a different scripting language it might be more portable to make the file executable (chmod u+x) and make sure the Shebang points to the right interpreter.</description>
