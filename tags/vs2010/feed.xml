      <description>Last week we noticed that the artefacts for a custom schema in our Database Project were not created (or updated). It took us a while to figure out what was wrong. When you add a script via the &amp;lsquo;Add Existing item&amp;rsquo; menu in VS2010 the file&amp;rsquo;s Build Action is set to Not in Build for some unknown reason. As soon as we changed the value to Build and Deployed again our artefacts were created.</description>
