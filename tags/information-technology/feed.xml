A while ago i started wondering if we still need an Event Aggregator in our compisite applications if we have an IOC container that takes cares of dependency wiring. An IOC container can easily inject the Event/MessageHandler(s) in the Event/MessagePublisher(s)&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure about the answer (Yes/No).</description></item><item><title>About dependencies</title><link>https://timvw.be/2010/01/26/about-dependencies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2010/01/26/about-dependencies/</guid><description>This weekend i noticed a couple of posts by Uncle Bob trying to get some discussions going. In Mocking Mocking and Testing Outcomes at some point he generates a fake of some class
“Oh, ick!” you say. Yes, I agree it’s a lot of code. On the other hand, it took me just a single keystroke on my IDE to generate all those dummy methods. (In IntelliJ it was simply command-I to implement all unimplemented methods.</description></item><item><title>About forced design</title><link>https://timvw.be/2010/01/23/about-forced-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2010/01/23/about-forced-design/</guid><description>if you need typemock your design is wrong.
Although i understand what people are trying to say with that quote, it&amp;rsquo;s wrong on many levels. I pretty much agree with everything that Roy wrote in Test driven design – Willed vs. Forced Designs. As some commenters pointed out it is hard to convince management that they need an isolation framework, let alone that they have to pay for one.</description></item><item><title>Bing vs Google in 5 seconds</title><link>https://timvw.be/2009/12/05/bing-vs-google-in-5-seconds/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2009/12/05/bing-vs-google-in-5-seconds/</guid><description>A while ago i sat in a meeting and some ms-fanboy used Bing to find out how much 60 inches were in meters. The first page had pages with conversion factors but none of them contained the actual answer. I suggested that he&amp;rsquo;d use Google instead and while he was keying in the question the answer already appeared.
Today i wanted to make a screencast of this difference in experience but it seems that bing has the &amp;lsquo;conversion&amp;rsquo; feature now too.</description></item><item><title>Configuring Apache to serve Office 2007 documents with the correct MIME type</title><link>https://timvw.be/2009/10/09/configuring-apache-to-serve-office-2007-documents-with-the-correct-mime-type/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2009/10/09/configuring-apache-to-serve-office-2007-documents-with-the-correct-mime-type/</guid><description>Untill now i haven&amp;rsquo;t published any Office 2007 documents but i noticed that my webhost hasn&amp;rsquo;t configured apache to serve such documents with the correct MIME types.

To find information. Thus, when you publish a page to announce that the information is not there (yet) you are wasting your visitors time. Instead of creating the actual content you wasted time while your were creating an under construction page. A loss-loss situation instead of a win-win one.
Admitted, in some cases it can be helpful to give your visitors an idea of what they can expect (eg: links to articles that are not written yet appear in red in the Presentation Patterns wiki), but in general: Under construction pages stink.</description></item><item><title>About reading books</title><link>https://timvw.be/2009/08/13/about-reading-books/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2009/08/13/about-reading-books/</guid><description>A while ago Gabriel wrote the following:
PS3: you can read all the books that you want, in the end to truly master .NET you need experience and more experience! Normally it would take you about 10 years of relevant experience to get to that level of expertise
I agree that expertise only comes from experience but i do believe that good books can guide you to the pit of success and help you recognize solutions that are doomed to fail.</description></item><item><title>Adding items to SendTo folder</title><link>https://timvw.be/2009/06/07/adding-items-to-sendto-folder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2009/06/07/adding-items-to-sendto-folder/</guid><description>When i tried to access the SendTo folder i got a message box saying: &amp;ldquo;Access is denied&amp;rdquo;.

Nowadays i have learned to live with it, but i guess i will never understand what all the fuss was about.
I can imagine that the marketing department will generate a lot of noise about Windows 7 but i am not convinced that there are actually people waiting for yet another OS. Anyway, i installed Windows 7 somewhere last week and i must say that i am pretty pleased with it.</description></item><item><title>Sparkles</title><link>https://timvw.be/2009/05/05/sparkles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2009/05/05/sparkles/</guid><description>In my opinion Pieter Gheysens is one of those persons that has contributed something valuable to the Belgian .Net community: Great Visug sessions and some interesting courses at Compuware so i shamelessly plug his new company Sparkles here.

Whenever i talked with people about distributing and deploying applications with a virtual machine image instead of a traditional installer they laughed at me (or atleast gave me a strange look of disbelief). The availability of multiple machines can be represented in a windowing environment through a metaphor of multiple desktops.</description></item><item><title>Pondering about code generation</title><link>https://timvw.be/2009/04/18/pondering-about-code-generation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2009/04/18/pondering-about-code-generation/</guid><description>A while ago i was listening to &amp;lsquo;Kathleen Dollard on MEF and More&amp;rsquo; on NET Rocks! and it got me thinking.
For a long time i considered code generation as a way to reduce the tedious parts of software development by spitting out considerable amounts of code and I immediately thought of tools like T4: Text Template Transformation Toolkit and GAT: Guidance Automation Toolkit.
I believe that in order to become more productive we need a solution that requires less code spitting by means of better frameworks and higher languages.</description></item><item><title>More on choosing names for tests</title><link>https://timvw.be/2008/09/06/more-on-choosing-names-for-tests/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2008/09/06/more-on-choosing-names-for-tests/</guid><description>Choosing names with the technique i presented yesterday leads to at least one class per method. To tackle that explosion of classes i have made two decisions:
Add a folder for each tested class, this way all the Whening classes are grouped. Create a single WhenUsingclass to group simple test methods. Here is a screenshot to clarify the changes:</description></item><item><title>Experimenting with naming conventions for unit tests</title><link>https://timvw.be/2008/09/05/experimenting-with-naming-conventions-for-unit-tests/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2008/09/05/experimenting-with-naming-conventions-for-unit-tests/</guid><description>To be honest, i never really took the time to think about the names of my unit tests. Although i noticed posts like this one and this one they never inspired me to think about it. Earlier this week, Yves Goeleven demonstrated the power of using BDD inspired naming conventions and i was immediately sold. I applied the style on a couple of tests in BeTimvwFramework and i must say that i like the resulting tests:</description></item><item><title>The never ending race</title><link>https://timvw.be/2008/08/16/the-never-ending-race/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2008/08/16/the-never-ending-race/</guid><description>You are probably wondering what all these short book reviews are all about. A little longer than two years ago i graduated and became a passionate .NET developer.

Under Book reviews you can find a list of books that have found a place on my bookshelf the last two years.</description></item><item><title>Note about makecert.exe</title><link>https://timvw.be/2008/06/21/note-about-makecert.exe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2008/06/21/note-about-makecert.exe/</guid><description>A couple of days ago i didn&amp;rsquo;t have a binary version of OpenSSL around so i decided to use Makecert.exe.
