      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are an &lt;a href=&#34;http://adblockplus.org/en/&#34;&gt;Adblock Plus&lt;/a&gt; user like me it is very likely that you have not noticed that i added Google Ads to this blog a month or two ago. Given that the total earnings are less than 5$ i have decided to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Heroes happened {Here}</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/belux/heroeshappenhere/default.aspx&#34;&gt;Heroes Happen Here&lt;/a&gt;. Even with a fullhouse this convention was well organized and evertyhing went pretty smooth (In my experience that is true for all events organised by Microsoft). One suggestion though: Reduce the sugar buffet (although the cake and muffins are very tasty) and add some healthy fruit ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad to notice, despite the fact that the main reason seems to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimisation&#34;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt;, web developers are encouraged to develop websites that work without JavaScript and that they add it afterwards as a real usability enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>About .Net events in Belgium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this evening i visited &amp;ldquo;Visual C++ &amp;lsquo;Orcas&amp;rsquo; and a Microsoft C++ Strategy&amp;rdquo;, an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/belux/msdn/nl/default.mspx&#34;&gt;MSDN Belux&lt;/a&gt; event. Since the events are for free, time would be the only thing you can loose&amp;hellip;. But as always with these events, they are worth the time. I even liked the jokes this time ;)) The speaker, Ronald Laeremans, now the Program Unit Manager for Visual C++ talked and kept talking about his passion ðŸ™‚ 30 minutes after his session &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/tommer/&#34;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; eventually found a way to stop him.. I can only recommend that you visit these events too&amp;hellip; Scheduled&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last days i&amp;rsquo;ve visited a couple of interesting sessions at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/belux/devitprodays/&#34;&gt;Developer &amp;amp; IT Pro Days 2007&lt;/a&gt;. All in all the event was pretty well organised&amp;hellip; In the closing word of the event, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/czhower/&#34;&gt;Chad Z. Hower&lt;/a&gt; found himself quite funny when he set the title of a form in an exception throwing application to &amp;lsquo;Java Application&amp;rsquo;. Unlike the rest of the crowd i didn&amp;rsquo;t see the humor in it&amp;hellip; Anyway, when his Visual Studio Orcas started choking i wet my pants too ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago i decided to install Vista Ultimate&amp;hellip; Despite the marketing efforts my only &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.experiencethewow.be/&#34;&gt;Wow&lt;/a&gt; experience was yesterday when i decided to remove it&amp;hellip; (Simply boot with your XP installation cd, run fixboot and fixmbr from the rescue console and you&amp;rsquo;re set ;))&lt;/p&gt;</description>
