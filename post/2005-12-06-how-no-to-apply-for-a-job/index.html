				<p>Today i was part of a jury looking for a junior programmer. Most of them had an extensive list with programming languages on their curriculum vitae, eg: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">html</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">xml</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">css</a>, &hellip; Ok, there are people out there that consider writing markup language is programming too.</p>
<p>Most of them mentionned they had some experiences with <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>. My first question was: What are the kind of problems you would solve with Perl? In which areas does it seem to be right tool? A couple of them told me that they had written a proxy server or used it on linux. Fine, but i would have expected at least one to tell me that Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language) seems to be the right tool for text manipulation&hellip;</p>
<p>Most people added experience with virtually every Microsoft Operating System on their list with skills. Most of them also mentionned experience with Linux. When i asked them about differences between Windows and <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> i didn&rsquo;t get any answers. They could have at least said that Perl on windows can be a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/PITA">PITA</a> ðŸ˜€ I got the feeling they have booted something like <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> a couple of times and consider that as experience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that knowing an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> by heart is really required, so i asked them the following: What is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>? Can you mention a couple of advantages and or disadvantages? How do you solve the problems that arise with recursion? You should have seen their faces turn white ðŸ˜› Most of them knew that it&rsquo;s a function that calls itself, and only one mentionned that it can lead to a stack overflow&hellip; Too bad that noone provided any tips for solving them more efficient or mentionned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Ackermann">Wilhelm Ackerman</a>.</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised by the poor answers on recursion so i decided not to ask them what a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/semaphore">semaphore</a> or a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/mutex.html">mutex</a> are&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>My Advise:</strong> If you mention any skills make sure they are actually skills&hellip; And if you are interested in a maintenance job, stay at home and don&rsquo;t waste our valuable time. We&rsquo;ll get back to you. Goodbye.</p>
