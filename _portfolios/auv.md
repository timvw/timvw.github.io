description: VARUN is the name of the autonomous underwater vehicle being developed by a team of undergraduate students under Robotics Club IIT Kanpur. I have spend more time on this that all the other projects (other that huracan) combined. Headover to <a href="https://auv-iitk.github.io">auv-iitk.github.io</a> for more details. We are using ROS and OpenCV for making the robot runs autonomously. All source code is open source and can be accessed at <a href="https://github.com/auv-iitk">github.com/auv-iitk</a>.
