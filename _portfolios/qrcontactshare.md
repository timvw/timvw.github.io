description: Gone are the days of typing phone number on dial pad while looking at a friends phone. With QR Contact Share this will become a memory of the past. No Bluetooth. No WiFi. Share a contact with Display. Select a contact to generate its QR code and scan it from another Phone to automatically add it to contact list. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ShikherVerma/QRContactShare">here</a>. This project uses ZBar Library. Update [May 2016] - This was my first app that I published on google play. Not available anymore.
