if (new HasReachedLevel(10).IsSatisfiedBy(player)) { view.DisplayMessage(&amp;#34;Congratulations!

There are times when the returning a static value is not good enough for the scenario that you are testing, so for those cases, you can use the Do() handler to add custom behavior when the method is called.

The Rhino Mocks project has been out there for a couple of years now and i&amp;rsquo;m pretty confident that it won&amp;rsquo;t go away anytime soon. The Moq project is a lot younger and will have to proove that it can stay alive&amp;hellip;
Anyway, because most people seem to digg the Moq API i have decided to write an adapter that provides the same API using Rhino Mocks.</description></item><item><title>xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code</title><link>https://timvw.be/2009/03/28/xunit-test-patterns-refactoring-test-code/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2009/03/28/xunit-test-patterns-refactoring-test-code/</guid><description>xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code starts with narratives on philosophy, principles, strategies and test smells.

We want an employee table and a shift table (which has the employee_id as a foreign key).
// Employee.java @OneToMany(targetEntity=Shift.class) public List getShifts() {...} // Shift.java @ManyToOne public Employee getEmployee() {...} The code above generates the following tables: employee, employee_shift and shift.

The protocol it talks is some plaintext language. I want to talk with it, but i do not want others to know what i am sending to it. I am lucky enough to have remote access to that machine via ssh. I setup a tunnel with the following command
ssh -N -L 12345:example:12345 timvw@example Now my program can connect to localhost:12345 and ssh will make sure that it ends up at example.</description></item><item><title>Accept posted XML data</title><link>https://timvw.be/2006/01/18/accept-posted-xml-data/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2006/01/18/accept-posted-xml-data/</guid><description>I remember that i have spent a lot of time finding something that allowed me to accept the posted XML data.

It is a function where the value for input n is calculated as a linear combination of the previous 1, 2, &amp;hellip;, n-1 function values. An example is the fibonacci function: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).
If we program this our first code would look like:
function fibonacci($n) { if ($n &amp;lt; = 1) { return $n; } return fibonacci($n-1) + fibonacci($n-2); } It becomes clear that this is really inefficient.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with CVS</title><link>https://timvw.be/2005/02/08/getting-started-with-cvs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timvw.be/2005/02/08/getting-started-with-cvs/</guid><description>I got an e-mail that asked me how to get started with CVS as quick as possible.

I also configured my mailclient, mutt, for use with GnuPG. I copied a sample file i found on the net but always got an error message: sh: line 1: pgpewrap: command not found. It appears that /usr/lib/mutt/ is not in the path and therefore is not found.

My code generates XML and then i translate it to XHTML with XSLT. However, if i write
&amp;lt;textarea name=&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt; it will be translated to:
&amp;lt;textarea name=&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34; /&amp;gt;. A not so good workaround is to write: (Notice the space in the xsl:text)
&amp;lt;textarea name=&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;xsl:text&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:text&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt; UPDATE on 2005-01-20 05:42
The solution is to use html as output method instead of xml.
