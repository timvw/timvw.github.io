In my opinion Pieter Gheysens is one of those persons that has contributed something valuable to the Belgian .Net community: Great Visug sessions and some interesting courses at Compuware so i shamelessly plug his new company [Sparkles](http://www.sparkles.be) here. Now go and find out how they can make you a better developer!
