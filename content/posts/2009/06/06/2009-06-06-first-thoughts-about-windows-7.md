title: First thoughts about Windows 7
---
It is almost two years ago that i decided to [uninstall Vista](http://www.timvw.be/about-the-wow-i-removed-vista-from-my-harddisk-experience/) after a bad first impression. Nowadays i have learned to live with it, but i guess i will never understand what all the fuss was about.

I can imagine that the marketing department will generate a lot of noise about Windows 7 but i am not convinced that there are actually people waiting for yet another OS. Anyway, i installed Windows 7 somewhere last week and i must say that i am pretty pleased with it. I guess that you didn't see that one coming, do you? Me, finally liking an operation system that comes from Microsoft ðŸ˜‰

PS: Forgot to mention that i do not like the fact that i can not have Windows Virtual PC and Virtual Server 2005 at the same time :/
