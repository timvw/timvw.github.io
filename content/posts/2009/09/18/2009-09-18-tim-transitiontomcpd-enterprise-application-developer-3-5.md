I figured that it might help convince people that i stay up to date with current technology so i decided to take (and pass) the following exams: [70-568](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-568&locale=en-us) and [70-569](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-569&locale=en-us). This means that i have now earned the following credentials:

  * MCPD: Enterprise Application Development 3.5
  * MCTS: .NET Framework 3.5, Windows Forms Applications
  * MCTS: .NET Framework 3.5, ASP.NET Applications
  * MCTS: .NET Framework 3.5, Windows Communication Foundation Applications
  * MCTS: .NET Framework 3.5, ADO.NET Applications
