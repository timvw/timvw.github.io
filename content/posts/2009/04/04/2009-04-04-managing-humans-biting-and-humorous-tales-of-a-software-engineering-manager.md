title: 'Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager'
---
A while ago i heared Joel Spolsky shamelessly promote [Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager](http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/159059844X) and decided to give it a read. No boring process descriptions, but short and consice chapters, fed with real life examples, transmitting the message to the reader. I loved reading this book.
