I already wrote that [GNU Core Utilities](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) ([GNU Textutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html)) have become my favorite text processing tools. Today i wanted to sort a couple of lines using the last three numbers of each line. Here is an example

```bash
c:/data/backup/JA-229
c:/data/backup/JA-221
c:/data/backup/JA-233
c:/data/backup/NE-046
c:/data/backup/NE-049
c:/data/backup/JA-217
c:/data/backup/JA-225
```

With the command "sort -n -t- -k2 myfile.txt" i quickly got what i needed.
