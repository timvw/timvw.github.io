When building distributed AI applications with [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp), proper observability becomes crucial. In this post, I'll show you how to combine [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) context propagation with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) to achieve seamless distributed tracing across your MCP client and server components.

## The Challenge

Modern AI applications often consist of multiple services communicating over the network. When using FastMCP to build Model Context Protocol servers, we need to:

1. Track requests as they flow from client to server
2. Monitor LLM interactions and their performance
3. Maintain trace context across service boundaries
4. Correlate logs and metrics with specific request traces

## The Solution: OpenTelemetry + Langfuse

By combining [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)'s distributed tracing capabilities with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/)'s LLM-specific observability features, we can achieve comprehensive monitoring of our AI applications.

## Implementation and How It Works

Let's build a weather assistant that demonstrates this integration. The complete example code is available on GitHub at [fastmcp-otel-langfuse](https://github.com/timvw/fastmcp-otel-langfuse).

### 1. OpenTelemetry Context Management

First, we create utility functions for context management in [`weather_assistant/utils/otel_utils.py`](https://github.com/timvw/fastmcp-otel-langfuse/blob/main/weather_assistant/utils/otel_utils.py):

- `with_otel_context()`: A context manager that extracts and activates OpenTelemetry context from carrier headers
- `with_otel_context_from_headers()`: A decorator that extracts HTTP headers and establishes OpenTelemetry context before Langfuse creates its spans

### 2. MCP Server with Tracing

The weather assistant server implementation in [`weather_assistant/server.py`](https://github.com/timvw/fastmcp-otel-langfuse/blob/main/weather_assistant/server.py) uses a decorator stack on each tool:

1. `@mcp.tool()` - Registers the function as an MCP tool
2. `@with_otel_context_from_headers` - Extracts and activates the OTel context from HTTP headers
3. `@observe` - Creates a Langfuse span within the active context

This ensures that server-side spans are properly linked to the client's trace context.

### 3. MCP Client with Trace Propagation

The client implementation in [`weather_assistant/client.py`](https://github.com/timvw/fastmcp-otel-langfuse/blob/main/weather_assistant/client.py) propagates trace context by:

1. Creating an OpenTelemetry span for the operation
2. Extracting the trace context using `inject(carrier)`
3. Passing the context as HTTP headers via `StreamableHttpTransport`

This enables distributed tracing across the client-server boundary.

### 4. Configuration

The configuration setup in [`weather_assistant/config/tracing.py`](https://github.com/timvw/fastmcp-otel-langfuse/blob/main/weather_assistant/config/tracing.py) initializes both OpenTelemetry and Langfuse with proper resource attributes and connection settings.

### 5. The Result

This approach provides:
- **Distributed traces** across client and server
- **LLM-specific metrics** from Langfuse
- **Automatic parent-child relationships** between spans
- **Correlation** between infrastructure and LLM metrics

## Benefits

1. **Complete Visibility**: See the entire request flow from client to server
2. **LLM Performance Tracking**: Monitor token usage, latency, and costs
3. **Debugging**: Easily trace issues across service boundaries
4. **Standards-Based**: Uses W3C Trace Context for compatibility

## Traces in Langfuse

After making requests through the weather assistant, you can view the distributed traces in [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/). The trace overview clearly shows the parent-child relationship between spans:

In this view, you can see:
- `weather_request` (client-side span) as the parent
- `handle_weather_request` (server-side span) nested as a child
- `get_weather` and `get_forecast` (individual tool calls) nested within the server span

This hierarchy demonstrates successful trace context propagation across the MCP client-server boundary.

Clicking on a specific span reveals detailed information about that operation, including input/output data and metadata:

## Conclusion

By combining [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) with [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp), we achieve comprehensive observability for distributed AI applications. The decorator-based approach keeps the code clean while ensuring proper context propagation across service boundaries.

This pattern scales well as your application grows - you can add more services, and the trace context will flow through all of them, giving you end-to-end visibility into your AI system's behavior.

Happy tracing! üîç‚ú®
