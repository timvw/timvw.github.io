Lately i felt the need to work on my management skills so apart from practicing each day i decided to search for some inspiration in [97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts](http://www.amazon.com/Things-Every-Project-Manager-Should/dp/0596804164). All i can say is that it's yet another book in the series that is worth reading.
