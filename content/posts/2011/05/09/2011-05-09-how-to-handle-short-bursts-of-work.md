Here is a summary of how businesses around me handle short bursts of work:

  * When i go to the doctor: 
      * find an empty seat in the waiting room
      * observe who's before me
      * wait untill all those people have been seen by the doctor


  * When i go to the supermarket: 
      * join the queue at the end
      * wait untill al before me have been helped


  * When i go the the bakery: 
      * get a number from a ticketing machine at the entrance
      * wait untill a seller indicates he's willing to process my requests


  * When i go to my car dealer:
  * hand over car keys
  * give my mobile phone number
  * relax in the loung untill they come find me (or send me an sms)</li>
