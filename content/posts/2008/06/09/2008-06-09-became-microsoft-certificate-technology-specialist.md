Not that i really care, but [my manager](http://wimvdd.blogspot.com) seems to do, last week, during a couple of dead moments at Tech-Ed North America (I'll blog about that later on this week) i decided to take a couple of exams ([70-536](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exams/70-536.mspx), [70-526](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exams/70-526.mspx) and [70-528](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exams/70-528.mspx)) and passed them ðŸ˜‰ 

This means that i'm now a [MCTS: .NET Framework 2.0 Windows Applications](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/winapps/default.mspx) and a [MCTS: .NET Framework 2.0 Web Applications](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/webapps/default.mspx).
