I'm back from [Heroes Happen Here](http://www.microsoft.com/belux/heroeshappenhere/default.aspx). Even with a fullhouse this convention was well organized and evertyhing went pretty smooth (In my experience that is true for all events organised by Microsoft). One suggestion though: Reduce the sugar buffet (although the cake and muffins are very tasty) and add some healthy fruit ðŸ˜‰

I'm glad to notice, despite the fact that the main reason seems to be [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimisation), web developers are encouraged to develop websites that work without JavaScript and that they add it afterwards as a real usability enhancement.
