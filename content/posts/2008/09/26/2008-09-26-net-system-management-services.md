title: .NET System Management Services
---
Earlier this week i finished reading [.NET System Management Services](http://www.amazon.com/System-Management-Services-Alexander-Golomshtok/dp/1590590589). Although the book was published back in 2003, it still contains a lot of useful information on using the classes in the [System.Management](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.aspx) namespace. I did not like the fact that the author really made the effort to explain each line of code in the book. On the other hand, the book contains a lot of useful tips that help with writing [WMI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation) queries, generating managed classes around WMI classes (and objects) and even applications that query [SNMP](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol) via WMI. All in all, i can recommend the book if you are going to use the System.Management API.
