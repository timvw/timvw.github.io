To be honest, i never really took the time to think about the names of my unit tests. Although i noticed posts like [this one](http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/archive/2007/12/17/approaching-bdd.aspx) and [this one](http://elegantcode.com/2008/05/01/thanks-to-bdd/) they never inspired me to think about it. Earlier this week, [Yves Goeleven](http://www.goeleven.com) demonstrated the power of using [BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development) inspired naming conventions and i was immediately sold. I applied the style on a couple of tests in [BeTimvwFramework](http://www.codeplex.com/BeTimvwFramework) and i must say that i like the resulting tests:
