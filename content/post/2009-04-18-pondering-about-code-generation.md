A while ago i was listening to ['Kathleen Dollard on MEF and More' on NET Rocks!](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=436) and it got me thinking.

For a long time i considered code generation as a way to reduce the tedious parts of software development by spitting out considerable amounts of code and I immediately thought of tools like [T4](msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx): Text Template Transformation Toolkit and [GAT](msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx): Guidance Automation Toolkit.

I believe that in order to become more productive we need a solution that requires less code spitting by means of better frameworks and higher languages. Eg: C# allows us to think about computer instructions on a much higher level than assembly language.

And then i realised that the C# compiler is nothing more than a code generation tool!
