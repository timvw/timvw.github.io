  * Allow users to copy text from the UI (Or was the UX argument an excuse for playing with new toys?)
  * MSTEST (I know that [Here are the features that i would love to see in Silverlight:

  * MSTEST (I know that](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut/) exists.)
  * Triggers (including data triggers)
  * Typed data templates
  * Uniform XAML (WPF: <Style TargetType={x:Type local:Foo}/> vs Silverlight: <Style TargetType={local:Foo}/>)
  * Uniform validation API (eg: Data Annotations has three flavors)
  * XAML with less namespaces (doesn't really matter if you're a designer only type)
  * Support for Desktop ('regular') .NET assemblies. As long as Desktop .NET assemblies are not supported, tools that automate the process of generating a 'shadow' .Silverlight project (eg: Prism has for each project a silverlight project that, ignoring the different assembly references, exists out of file references to the orginal project).
  * UniformGrid

Note: This list is not exhaustive and may change in the future.
