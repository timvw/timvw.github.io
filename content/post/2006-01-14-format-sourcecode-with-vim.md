I once read an article that explained how i could make [Vim](http://www.vim.org) format my code but i forgot what the command was. Many websearches for "vim indent code" later i had the luminous idea to search for "vim format code" instead. The first site i visited already had the answer i had been looking for: "gg=G". Simple as that.
