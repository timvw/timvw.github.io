For my summer holidays i needed a book that was easy readable (size, weight, content) and [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) was a perfect match for my reading sessions at the pool. Even better, i found inspiration to write cleaner (and thus better) code. This book is most certainly recommend!
