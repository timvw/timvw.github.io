Having heared only positive things about [Dino Esposito](http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/)'s way of writing i decided to read [Programming Microsoft ASP.NET 3.5](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Microsoft-ASP-NET-Dino-Esposito/dp/0735625271). The book is written in a way that invites you to read and experiment with the contents. It covered the essentials of ASP.NET programming but i did not have the feeling that it added much to what i had read in [Professional ASP.NET 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-ASP-NET-2-0-Programmer/dp/0764576100). After a while i became annoyed with the numerous references to [Programming Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 Applications: Advanced Topics](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735621772/sr=1-1/qid=1156801743/ref=sr_1_1/104-6313703-3867159?ie=UTF8&s=books).
