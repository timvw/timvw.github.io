Earlier this week my build failed because maven was not able to resolve an (indirect) dependency on some package. It took me a while to notice that the dependency node in the pom file had an extra attribute: type = bundle. It only took a couple of minutes to find a good explanation [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14913615/osgi-bundle-vs-jar-dependency). Build fixed ðŸ˜‰
