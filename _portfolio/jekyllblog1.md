description: Yet another theme for jekyll. Actually this is the current website itself. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/ShikherVerma/shikherverma.github.io">here</a>. This theme contains some major enhancements which are usually not present in other themes. You have blog post categories, blog is not the default landing page but a sub directory, google analytics, disque comments, read time estimation, jekyll collection for portfolio items, search, travis integration. I was earlier using Freelancer theme before I added blog to my website.
