description: Yet another theme for jekyll. This is the website I build for AUV. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/AUV-IITK/AUV-IITK.github.io">here</a>. This theme contains some major enhancements which are usually not present in other themes. You have blog post tags, blog is not the default landing page but a sub directory, read time estimation, jekyll collection for team, vehicles, search, travis integration.
