A regular expression is a domain specific language for identifying parts in text and is one of those things every software developer should have learned. I ordered my copy of [Mastering regular expressions](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/1565922573) way back in 2001 and found it incredibly good! Allthough there are books that cover a specific dialect better, i still think this book is recommended because it also teaches the reader to read regular expressions.
