<p>Last week or so I got myself a MacBook Air and I am really loving it so far. Today I needed to use my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;eid.belgium.be&#47;en&#47;">eID<&#47;a> so I installed the middleware application without any hassle but had a hard time configuring Safari. Apparently Apply removed support for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;PKCS_?11">PKCS #11<&#47;a> in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apple.com&#47;osx&#47;">OS X Mountain Lion<&#47;a>. After installing <a href="http:&#47;&#47;smartcardservices.macosforge.org">SmartCard Services<&#47;a> the certificates appeared in the Keychain and I became able to authenticate on websites using my certificate<&#47;p></p>
