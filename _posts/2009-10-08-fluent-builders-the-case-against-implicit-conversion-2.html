<p>Here is another example that demonstrates how implicit conversion in a Fluent Builder can lead to surprises (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;elegantcode.com&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;21&#47;be-careful-with-the-var-keyword-and-expression-builders&#47;">Jan Van Ryswyck noticed this too<&#47;a>). Originally the code in my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.timvw.be&#47;fluent-builders-the-case-against-implicit-conversion&#47;">previous example<&#47;a> was the following:<&#47;p></p>
<p>[code lang="csharp"]var order = new OrderBuilder();[&#47;code]</p>
<p>Wich would make the c# compiler conclude that order is an OrderBuilder instead of an Order.<&#47;p></p>
