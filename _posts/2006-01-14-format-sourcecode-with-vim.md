<p>I once read an article that explained how i could make <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> format my code but i forgot what the command was. Many websearches for "vim indent code" later i had the luminous idea to search for "vim format code" instead. The first site i visited already had the answer i had been looking for: "gg=G". Simple as that :)</p>
