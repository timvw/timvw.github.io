<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047">Beautiful Code: Leading Programmers Explain How They Think</a> is another book that i started reading a couple of weeks ago. A couple of chapters were pretty interesting but i skipped the parts with large chunks of code because i get bored with code in books. Code should be read on a computer display in an editor! Despite many others, i can't say that this book was worth it.</p>
<p>Reading this book made me realize that posting large chunks of code in a blog post is boring too. So i have decided to write more about ideas and concepts instead of code.</p>
