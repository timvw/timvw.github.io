A couple of months ago i've read [The Art of Agile Development](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1218864880&sr=1-1). Like most books on agile, this book uses the [XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) methodology to provide guidance for agile development. I especially liked the last chapter, seek technical excellence, where the authors remind the reader that what ultimately matters is success and that the practices, principles and values are merely guides along the way.
