A while ago we had a session on [messaging](http://www.altdotnet.be/14/section.aspx/16) at [ALT.NET Belgium](http://www.altdotnet.be/) and it was then that i decided i should order my copy of [Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions](http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321200683). I found first half of the book pretty interesting but got bored around chapter 8 and skipped some sections from there. All in all this book this book is pretty good and if you know a thing or two about TCP/IP implementations you might even recognize some patterns in a different problem space.
