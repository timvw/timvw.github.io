<p>A while ago we had a session on <a href="http://www.altdotnet.be/14/section.aspx/16">messaging</a> at <a href="http://www.altdotnet.be/">ALT.NET Belgium</a> and it was then that i decided i should order my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321200683">Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions</a>. I found first half of the book pretty interesting but got bored around chapter 8 and skipped some sections from there. All in all this book this book is pretty good and if you know a thing or two about TCP/IP implementations you might even recognize some patterns in a different problem space.</p>
