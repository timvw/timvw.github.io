<p>A while ago i noticed that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;davybrion.com&#47;blog&#47;2010&#47;01&#47;highly-recommended-book-debug-it&#47;">Davy Brion<&#47;a> recommended <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pragprog.com&#47;titles&#47;pbdp&#47;debug-it">Debug It!: Find, Repair, and Prevent Bugs in Your Code<&#47;a> so i decided to give it a read. Although i really liked the suggested process for investigating bugs where you have absolutely no clue of what is going on, i am not convinced that this is a must read book.<&#47;p></p>
