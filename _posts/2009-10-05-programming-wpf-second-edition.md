<p>I felt it was time to get up to speed with WPF so i decided to buy <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510374">Programming WPF, Second edition</a>. This book answered a lot of my  newbie questions (where is the application entry point etc) right from the start. I liked it so much that i decided to read a second time ;) Most definitely recommended.</p>
