I felt it was time to get up to speed with WPF so i decided to buy [Programming WPF, Second edition](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510374). This book answered a lot of my newbie questions (where is the application entry point etc) right from the start. I liked it so much that i decided to read a second time ðŸ˜‰ Most definitely recommended.
