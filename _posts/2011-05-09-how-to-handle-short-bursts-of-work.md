<p>Here is a summary of how businesses around me handle short bursts of work:</p>

<ul>
 <li>When i go to the doctor:
  <ul>
   <li>find an empty seat in the waiting room</li>
   <li>observe who's before me</li>
   <li>wait untill all those people have been seen by the doctor</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

<br/>

 <li>When i go to the supermarket:
  <ul>
   <li>join the queue at the end</li>
   <li>wait untill al before me have been helped</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

<br/>

 <li>When i go the the bakery:
  <ul>
   <li>get a number from a ticketing machine at the entrance</li>
   <li>wait untill a seller indicates he's willing to process my requests</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

<br/>

 <li>When i go to my car dealer:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>hand over car keys</li>
   <li>give my mobile phone number</li>
   <li>relax in the loung untill they come find me (or send me an sms)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <br/>

</ul>
