    "Reading this book made me realize that posting large chunks of code in a blog post is boring too. So i have decided to write more about ideas and concepts instead of code."

    Couldn't agree more! Looking forward to your ideas and some of those concepts :p

<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice&#47;dp&#47;0596510047">Beautiful Code: Leading Programmers Explain How They Think<&#47;a> is another book that i started reading a couple of weeks ago. A couple of chapters were pretty interesting but i skipped the parts with large chunks of code because i get bored with code in books. Code should be read on a computer display in an editor! Despite many others, i can't say that this book was worth it.<&#47;p></p>
