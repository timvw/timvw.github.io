<p>Having seen Juval Loway deliver a session on WCF for the x-th time this year i found it was time to read <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Programming-WCF-Services-Juval-Lowy&#47;dp&#47;0596526997">Programming WCF Services<&#47;a>. This book is a reference work loaded with architectural advice.<&#47;p></p>
