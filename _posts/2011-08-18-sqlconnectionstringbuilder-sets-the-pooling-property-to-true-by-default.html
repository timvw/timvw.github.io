  content: I agree that in general connection pooling is something desirable. But
    sometimes you don't want to pay upfront (allocating system resources you don't
    need) or suffer the pain when some applications don't behave well.

<p>Here is something that surprised me: SqlConnectionStringBuilder sets the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnectionstringbuilder.pooling.aspx">Pooling<&#47;a> property to true by default.<&#47;p></p>
