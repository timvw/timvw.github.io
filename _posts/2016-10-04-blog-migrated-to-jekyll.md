As many other people I have decided to leave Wordpress behind and move to Jekyll instead.

Most posts have been migrated pretty well but I do not feel like bothering with them anymore.
In fact, some of them have become irrelevant, some of them are just wrong and others only attract spammers. In summary: they are not worth my time anymore. In case you really loved them, you can still send a pull-request :P
