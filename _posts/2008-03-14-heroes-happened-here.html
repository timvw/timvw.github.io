<p>I'm back from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;belux&#47;heroeshappenhere&#47;default.aspx">Heroes Happen Here<&#47;a>. Even with a fullhouse this convention was well organized and evertyhing went pretty smooth (In my experience that is true for all events organised by Microsoft). One suggestion though: Reduce the sugar buffet (although the cake and muffins are very tasty) and add some healthy fruit ;)<&#47;p></p>
<p>I'm glad to notice, despite the fact that the main reason seems to be <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Search_engine_optimisation">SEO<&#47;a>, web developers are encouraged to develop websites that work without JavaScript and that they add it afterwards as a real usability enhancement.<&#47;p></p>
