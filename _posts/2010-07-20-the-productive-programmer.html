<p>The first part of the book covers some tools that may improve your productivity (but nothing that i did not use already). The second part covers development techniques (again, nothing new under the sun). Despite the author's intentions i found reading <a href="http:&#47;&#47;oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;9780596519544">The Productive Programmer<&#47;a> a disappointment.<&#47;p></p>
