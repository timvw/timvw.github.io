<p>Earlier this evening i visited "Visual C++ 'Orcas' and a Microsoft C++ Strategy", an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/msdn/nl/default.mspx">MSDN Belux</a> event. Since the events are for free, time would be the only thing you can loose.... But as always with these events, they are worth the time. I even liked the jokes this time ;)) The speaker, Ronald Laeremans, now the Program Unit Manager for Visual C++ talked and kept talking about his passion :) 30 minutes after his session <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tommer/">Tom</a> eventually found a way to stop him.. I can only recommend that you visit these events too... Scheduled:</p>
<ul>
<li>May 10th, <a href="http://www.visug.be/Default.aspx">Introduction on IIS7</a> (I won't be there since i already saw the presentation at DevDays)</li>
<li>June 6th, <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032340308&Culture=en-US">Securing ASP.NET AJAX enabled web applications, lessons from the field</a></li>
</ul>
