Earlier this evening i visited "Visual C++ 'Orcas' and a Microsoft C++ Strategy", an [MSDN Belux](http://www.microsoft.com/belux/msdn/nl/default.mspx) event. Since the events are for free, time would be the only thing you can loose.... But as always with these events, they are worth the time. I even liked the jokes this time ;)) The speaker, Ronald Laeremans, now the Program Unit Manager for Visual C++ talked and kept talking about his passion ðŸ™‚ 30 minutes after his session [Tom](http://blogs.msdn.com/tommer/) eventually found a way to stop him.. I can only recommend that you visit these events too... Scheduled

* May 10th, [Introduction on IIS7](http://www.visug.be/Default.aspx) (I won't be there since i already saw the presentation at DevDays)
* June 6th, [Securing ASP.NET AJAX enabled web applications, lessons from the field](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032340308&Culture=en-US)
