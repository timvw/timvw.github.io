<p>Around new year i found out that i would be working with SQL Server 2008 so i needed a crash course. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-Internals&#47;dp&#47;0735626243">Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Internals<&#47;a> is really not intended to be that, but it does cover the basics and then dives (way too) deep in detail. Although i stopped reading halfway the dives i found the book very interesting!<&#47;p></p>
