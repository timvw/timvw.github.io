<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Deploying-NET-Applications-Learning-ClickOnce&#47;dp&#47;1590596528">Deploying .NET Applications: Learning MSBuild and ClickOnce<&#47;a> is a book that will help you grasp the core concepts of MSBuild. This book is a great headstart if you're starting out with MSBuild and find the documentation confusing. The second part of the book, about clickonce, was less interesting. I'm still waiting for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sedodream.com&#47;">Sayed Ibrahim Hashimi<&#47;a> to release a book that only convers MSBuild.<&#47;p></p>
