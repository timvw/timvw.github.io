A while ago i sat in a meeting and some ms-fanboy used [Bing](http://www.bing.com) to find out how much 60 inches were in meters. The first page had pages with conversion factors but none of them contained the actual answer. I suggested that he'd use [Google](http://www.google.com) instead and while he was keying in the question the answer already appeared.

Today i wanted to make a screencast of this difference in experience but it seems that bing has the 'conversion' feature now too. Wondering about what would make me switch search engines...
