Today i downloaded the freely available [MSDN Library (May 2006 Edition)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=373930CB-A3D7-4EA5-B421-DD6818DC7C41&displaylang=en). I appended .iso to the filenames and mounted the first image with [Nero ImageDrive](http://ww2.nero.com/nero6/eng/Nero_ImageDrive_prev.html). After a while i got the following error message: "Source file not found: _17693_RTL_x86_enu_NET_Framework_SDK_HxS.cab".

![error message with msdn library installer](http://www.timvw.be/wp-content/images/msdn-library-2006-05-error.jpg)

Apparently this file exists on the second disk (Why doesn't the installer ask me to insert the second disk?). And yes, a little while later the same thing happens again when the third disk is expected....
