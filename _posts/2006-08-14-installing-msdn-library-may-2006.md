<p>Today i downloaded the freely available <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=373930CB-A3D7-4EA5-B421-DD6818DC7C41&displaylang=en">MSDN Library (May 2006 Edition)</a>. I appended .iso to the filenames and mounted the first image with <a href="http://ww2.nero.com/nero6/eng/Nero_ImageDrive_prev.html">Nero ImageDrive</a>. After a while i got the following error message: "Source file not found: _17693_RTL_x86_enu_NET_Framework_SDK_HxS.cab".</p>

<p>Apparently this file exists on the second disk (Why doesn't the installer ask me to insert the second disk?). And yes, a little while later the same thing happens again when the third disk is expected....</p>
