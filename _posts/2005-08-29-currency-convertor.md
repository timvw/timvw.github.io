I discovered that the [European Central Bank (ECB)](http://www.ecb.int) has a page with [Euro foreign exchange rates](http://www.ecb.int/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html). I thought it would be a nice exercise to write a little script that works with the [XML data](http://www.ecb.int/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.xml) source. Get [currencyconvertor.txt](http://www.timvw.be/wp-content/code/php/currencyconvertor.txt) now!
