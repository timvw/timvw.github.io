    Grab a copy of the book, look at the table of contents and you'll understand.

    With part 1 i mean chapters 1 to 4.
    With part 2 i mean chapters 5 to 11.

<p>Earlier this month i ordered my copy of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Refactoring-Patterns-Joshua-Kerievsky&#47;dp&#47;0321213351">Refactoring to Patterns<&#47;a>. This books has two parts: the first part describes patterns and code smells (anti-patterns) and the second part is a catalog of refactorings. The first part is not bad, but i appreciated the second part much more. I did not read the book from front to cover and skipped the 'mechanics' sections (abstract steps to take in order to accomplish a particular refactoring). I focussed on the 'example' sections instead which demonstrate the application of the previously mentionned mechanics.<&#47;p></p>
<p>During the reading of this book i had a couple of 'aha' moments which gave me the feeling that i understood (appreciated) a certain pattern better. All in all a good book to read.<&#47;p></p>
