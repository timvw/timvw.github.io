Around new year i found out that i would be working with SQL Server 2008 so i needed a crash course. [Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Internals](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-Internals/dp/0735626243) is really not intended to be that, but it does cover the basics and then dives (way too) deep in detail. Although i stopped reading halfway the dives i found the book very interesting!
