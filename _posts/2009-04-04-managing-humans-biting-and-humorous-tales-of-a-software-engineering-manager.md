<p>A while ago i heared Joel Spolsky shamelessly promote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/159059844X">Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager</a> and decided to give it a read. No boring process descriptions, but short and consice chapters, fed with real life examples, transmitting the message to the reader. I loved reading this book.</p>
