At first i developed most WPF interfaces by writing XAML in the code view of Visual Studio. Those days are gone 😉 These days i find it a lot easier to use Expression Blend (eg: paths, animations and timelines) but i reallly don't like it that Blend adds design-time information to the XAML that is intended to be used in production code. A tool should not add clutter to your code!

I also dislike the fact that Blend adds values for Width and Height to each element by default. This requires me to hit that 'auto' square in the properties window for each element. What a waste of time 🙁
