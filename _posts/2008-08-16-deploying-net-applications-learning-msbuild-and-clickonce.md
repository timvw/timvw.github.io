<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Deploying-NET-Applications-Learning-ClickOnce/dp/1590596528">Deploying .NET Applications: Learning MSBuild and ClickOnce</a> is a book that will help you grasp the core concepts of MSBuild. This book is a great headstart if you're starting out with MSBuild and find the documentation confusing. The second part of the book, about clickonce, was less interesting. I'm still waiting for <a href="http://www.sedodream.com/">Sayed Ibrahim Hashimi</a> to release a book that only convers MSBuild.</p>
