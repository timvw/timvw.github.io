[Deploying .NET Applications: Learning MSBuild and ClickOnce](http://www.amazon.com/Deploying-NET-Applications-Learning-ClickOnce/dp/1590596528) is a book that will help you grasp the core concepts of MSBuild. This book is a great headstart if you're starting out with MSBuild and find the documentation confusing. The second part of the book, about clickonce, was less interesting. I'm still waiting for [Sayed Ibrahim Hashimi](http://www.sedodream.com/) to release a book that only convers MSBuild.
