<p>Having heared only positive things about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;despos&#47;">Dino Esposito<&#47;a>'s way of writing i decided to read <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Programming-Microsoft-ASP-NET-Dino-Esposito&#47;dp&#47;0735625271">Programming Microsoft ASP.NET 3.5<&#47;a>. The book is written in a way that invites you to read and experiment with the contents. It covered the essentials of ASP.NET programming but i did not have the feeling that it added much to what i had read in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Professional-ASP-NET-2-0-Programmer&#47;dp&#47;0764576100">Professional ASP.NET 2.0<&#47;a>. After a while i became annoyed with the numerous references to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;0735621772&#47;sr=1-1&#47;qid=1156801743&#47;ref=sr_1_1&#47;104-6313703-3867159?ie=UTF8&s=books">Programming Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 Applications: Advanced Topics<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
