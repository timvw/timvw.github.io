    Hi Tim

    Thanks for the positive feedback, glad you're enjoying the book :-)

<p>Last week i received my copy of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;NHibernate-Action-Pierre-Henri-Kuat%C3%A9&#47;dp&#47;1932394923">NHibernate in Action<&#47;a>. This book provides much more than the typical examples you find in the product documentation like architectural guidance on the application of O&#47;R Mapping. Even with my Hibernate experience i found some interesting insights in the NHibernate features. This book is most certainly recommended!<&#47;p></p>
