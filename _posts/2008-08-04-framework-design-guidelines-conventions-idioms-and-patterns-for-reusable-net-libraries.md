I finally found some time to read [Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries](http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Development/dp/0321246756) this week. The book is loaded with annotations for the do and do not lists that this book contains. There is almost no code... I'm looking forward to the [second edition](http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Development/dp/0321545613/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1217864039&sr=1-2).
