<p>I finally found some time to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Development/dp/0321246756">Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries</a> this week. The book is loaded with annotations for the do and do not lists that this book contains. There is almost no code... I'm looking forward to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Development/dp/0321545613/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1217864039&sr=1-2">second edition</a>.</p>
