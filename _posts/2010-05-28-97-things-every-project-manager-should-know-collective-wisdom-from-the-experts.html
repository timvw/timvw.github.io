<p>Lately i felt the need to work on my management skills so apart from practicing each day i decided to search for some inspiration in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Things-Every-Project-Manager-Should&#47;dp&#47;0596804164">97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts<&#47;a>. All i can say is that it's yet another book in the series that is worth reading.<&#47;p></p>
