<p>A while ago i noticed that more and more of my work is related to coaching and managing other developers. In order to become better at that i ordered my copy of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pragprog.com&#47;titles&#47;jrpm&#47;manage-it">Manage It!: Your Guide to Modern Pragmatic Project Management<&#47;a>. A book with plenty of useful (practical) tips. Definitely worth reading!<&#47;p></p>
