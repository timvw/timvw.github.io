<p>A while ago i was listening to <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=436">'Kathleen Dollard on MEF and More' on NET Rocks!</a> and it got me thinking.</p>

<p>For a long time i considered code generation as a way to reduce the tedious parts of software development by spitting out considerable amounts of code and I immediately thought of tools like <a href="msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx">T4</a>: Text Template Transformation Toolkit and <a href="msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx ">GAT</a>: Guidance Automation Toolkit.</p>

<p>I believe that in order to become more productive we need a solution that requires less code spitting by means of better frameworks and higher languages. Eg: C# allows us to think about computer instructions on a much higher level than assembly language.</p>

<p>And then i realised that the C# compiler is nothing more than a code generation tool!</p>
