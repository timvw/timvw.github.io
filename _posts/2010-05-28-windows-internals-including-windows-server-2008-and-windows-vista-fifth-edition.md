Given the fact that i have been developing software for MS-Windows the last couple of years i found it important to learn a bit more about the internals of the operating systems on which my applications run so i ordered a copy of [Windows Internals: Including Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, Fifth Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Windows%C2%AE-Internals-Including-Windows-PRO-Developer/dp/0735625301) back in september and learned quite a bit from the chapters that i found interesting: security, authorization, networking and analyzing crashes. I skimmed through the chapters on memory management, scheduling and file systems because they reminded me too much of Tanenbaum's excellent [Modern Operating Systems](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0136006639/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).
