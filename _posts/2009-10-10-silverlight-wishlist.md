<p>Here are the features that i would love to see in Silverlight:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow users to copy text from the UI (Or was the UX argument an excuse for playing with new toys?)</li>
<li>MSTEST (I know that <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut/">Silverlight Unit Test Framework </a> exists.)</li>
<li>Triggers (including data triggers)</li>
<li>Typed data templates</li>
<li>Uniform XAML (WPF: &lt;Style TargetType={x:Type local:Foo}/&gt; vs Silverlight: &lt;Style TargetType={local:Foo}/&gt;)</li>
<li>Uniform validation API (eg: Data Annotations has three flavors)</li>
<li>XAML with less namespaces (doesn't really matter if you're a designer only type)</li>
<li>Support for Desktop ('regular') .NET assemblies. As long as Desktop .NET assemblies are not supported, tools that automate the process of generating a 'shadow' .Silverlight project (eg: Prism has for each project a silverlight project that, ignoring the different assembly references, exists out of file references to the orginal project).</li>
<li>UniformGrid</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This list is not exhaustive and may change in the future.</p>
