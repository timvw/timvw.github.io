<p>Because most people have their java enabled mobile phone with them, and I did not want to buy an expensive token generator I decided to write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDlet">MIDlet</a> that can generate passwords as specified in the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mraihi-totp-timebased-00.txt">TOTP</a> algorithm. This project is build with <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit">Sun Java Wireless Toolkit for CLDC</a>. Feel free to download the sources, <a href="http://www.timvw.be/wp-content/code/java/TimeOTPClient.zip">TimeOTPClient.zip</a>.</p>
