<p>Although i was most of the week in bed with a cold i managed to finish reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Microsoft-ASP-NET-2-0-Applications/dp/0735621772">Programming Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 Applications: Advanced Topics</a>. This book contained less references to the previous book (luckily, because that one has been superseded now). I found it a bit confusing when the author explained half of a topic, diversified to something completely different, and then finished the topic. If you want some more insight in the ASP.NET machinery this book is recommended. What i did miss is a section on the inner workings of View State and change tracking but i have yet to find a book that covers this topic.</p>
