<p>I've already written that i like the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gnu.org&#47;software&#47;textutils&#47;textutils.html">GNU Textutils<&#47;a> a lot. Today someone had the following problem: A textfile with words. It's possible that a word is repeated a couple of times. He wants to generate a newfile without duplicate words. The solution is pretty simple:<&#47;p><br />
[code lang="bash"]<br />
sort words.txt | uniq > newfile.txt<br />
[&#47;code]</p>
