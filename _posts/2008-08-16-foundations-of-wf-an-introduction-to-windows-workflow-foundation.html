<p>Last month i found out that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Foundations-WF-Introduction-Workflow-Foundation&#47;dp&#47;1590597184">Foundations of WF: an Introduction to Windows Workflow Foundation<&#47;a> is a little book that does nothing more than guide you through visual studio wizards. Since i was expecting a book that would introduce me to the concepts and architectural decisions of wf i was disappointed. Not recommended.<&#47;p></p>
