Last month i found out that [Foundations of WF: an Introduction to Windows Workflow Foundation](http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-WF-Introduction-Workflow-Foundation/dp/1590597184) is a little book that does nothing more than guide you through visual studio wizards. Since i was expecting a book that would introduce me to the concepts and architectural decisions of wf i was disappointed. Not recommended.
