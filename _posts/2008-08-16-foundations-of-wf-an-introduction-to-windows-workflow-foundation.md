<p>Last month i found out that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-WF-Introduction-Workflow-Foundation/dp/1590597184">Foundations of WF: an Introduction to Windows Workflow Foundation</a> is a little book that does nothing more than guide you through visual studio wizards. Since i was expecting a book that would introduce me to the concepts and architectural decisions of wf i was disappointed. Not recommended.</p>
