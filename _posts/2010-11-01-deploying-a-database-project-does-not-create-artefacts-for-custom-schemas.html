<p>Last week we noticed that the artefacts for a custom schema in our Database Project were not created (or updated). It took us a while to figure out what was wrong. When you add a script via the 'Add Existing item' menu in VS2010 the file's <b>Build Action<&#47;b> is set to <b>Not in Build<&#47;b> for some unknown reason. As soon as we changed the value to <b>Build<&#47;b> and Deployed again our artefacts were created.<&#47;p></p>
