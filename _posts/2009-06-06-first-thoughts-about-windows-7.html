  content: I am in the same boat - ever since I bought HP laptop with Vista on it
    I had nothing but frustration with Vista. So, I am pulling my butcher knife this
    weekend - bye-bye Vista! I will give Windows 7 RC a try and if I don't like it
    either - back to XP with no frills or WOWs.

<p>It is almost two years ago that i decided to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.timvw.be&#47;about-the-wow-i-removed-vista-from-my-harddisk-experience&#47;">uninstall Vista<&#47;a> after a bad first impression. Nowadays i have learned to live with it, but i guess i will never understand what all the fuss was about.<&#47;p></p>
<p>I can imagine that the marketing department will generate a lot of noise about Windows 7 but i am not convinced that there are actually people waiting for yet another OS. Anyway, i installed Windows 7 somewhere last week and i must say that i am pretty pleased with it. I guess that you didn't see that one coming, do you? Me, finally liking an operation system that comes from Microsoft ;-)<&#47;p></p>
<p>PS: Forgot to mention that i do not like the fact that i can not have Windows Virtual PC and Virtual Server 2005 at the same time :&#47;<&#47;p></p>
