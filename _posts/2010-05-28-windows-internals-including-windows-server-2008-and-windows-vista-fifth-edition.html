<p>Given the fact that i have been developing software for MS-Windows the last couple of years i found it important to learn a bit more about the internals of the operating systems on which my applications run so i ordered a copy of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Windows%C2%AE-Internals-Including-Windows-PRO-Developer&#47;dp&#47;0735625301">Windows Internals: Including Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, Fifth Edition<&#47;a> back in september and learned quite a bit from the chapters that i found interesting: security, authorization, networking and analyzing crashes. I skimmed through the chapters on memory management, scheduling and file systems because they reminded me too much of Tanenbaum's excellent <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum&#47;dp&#47;0136006639&#47;ref=dp_ob_title_bk">Modern Operating Systems<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
