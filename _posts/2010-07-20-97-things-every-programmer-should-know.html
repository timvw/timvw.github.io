<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;9780596809492">97 Things Every Programmer Should Know<&#47;a> was the last book that i wanted to read at the pool during summer holidays. As with all 97 things books you get a lot of valuable tips but i found this book not as exciting as the previous ones...<&#47;p></p>
