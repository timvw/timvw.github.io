<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/xUnit-Test-Patterns-Refactoring-Addison-Wesley/dp/0131495054">xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code</a> starts with narratives on philosophy, principles, strategies and test smells. The second part covers test smells but i skimmed through these chapters because i have already had the joy to experience these anti-patterns first hand :( Most chapters in the third part, covering actual patterns, caught my attention and inspired me. Although it's quite big, 700+ pages, this book is most certainly recommended!</p>
