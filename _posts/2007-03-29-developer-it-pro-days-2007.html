<p>Last days i've visited a couple of interesting sessions at the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;belux&#47;devitprodays&#47;">Developer & IT Pro Days 2007<&#47;a>. All in all the event was pretty well organised... In the closing word of the event, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;czhower&#47;">Chad Z. Hower<&#47;a> found himself quite funny when he set the title of a form in an exception throwing application to 'Java Application'. Unlike the rest of the crowd i didn't see the humor in it...   Anyway, when his Visual Studio Orcas started choking i wet my pants too ;)<&#47;p></p>
