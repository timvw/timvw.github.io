Not going to waste time re-iterating what's in the book because you can find that here: [Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash](http://www.poppendieck.com/ilsd.htm). Just make sure that you get your copy and read it from beginning to end. Afterwards you may want to hand it over to your manager ðŸ˜‰
