<p>A couple of weeks ago i've re-read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>. Just like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201633612">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a> this is a book that i consider to b e required literature for every developer.</p>
