A couple of weeks ago i've re-read [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215). Just like [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201633612) and [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420) this is a book that i consider to b e required literature for every developer.
