<p>Recently i wrote a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.timvw.be&#47;wp-content&#47;code&#47;php&#47;banner.txt">banner system<&#47;a> that displays different banners based on the visitor's  country. It uses the remote address to find the country associated with that address (using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.maxmind.com&#47;">geoip<&#47;a>), and then it looks in the database to find a url for that country. If there is no such url, it looks up the default url. And finally it redirects the visitor to the url.<&#47;p></p>
