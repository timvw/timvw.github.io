<p>Today i was part of a jury looking for a junior programmer. Most of them had an extensive list with programming languages on their curriculum vitae, eg: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.w3.org&#47;TR&#47;html4&#47;">html<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.w3.org&#47;XML&#47;">xml<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.w3.org&#47;Style&#47;CSS&#47;">css<&#47;a>, ... Ok, there are people out there that consider writing markup language is programming too.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Most of them mentionned they had some experiences with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.perl.org">Perl<&#47;a>. My first question was: What are the kind of problems you would solve with Perl? In which areas does it seem to be right tool? A couple of them told me that they had written a proxy server or used it on linux. Fine, but i would have expected at least one to tell me that Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language) seems to be the right tool for text manipulation...<&#47;p></p>
<p>Most people added experience with virtually every Microsoft Operating System on their list with skills. Most of them also mentionned experience with Linux. When i asked them about differences between Windows and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.linux.org">Linux<&#47;a> i didn't get any answers. They could have at least said that Perl on windows can be a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wiktionary.org&#47;wiki&#47;PITA">PITA<&#47;a> :D I got the feeling they have booted something like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ubuntulinux.org&#47;">Ubuntu<&#47;a> a couple of times and consider that as experience. <&#47;p></p>
<p>I don't think that knowing an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;API">API<&#47;a> by heart is really required, so i asked them the following: What is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Recursion">recursion<&#47;a>? Can you mention a couple of advantages and or disadvantages? How do you solve the problems that arise with recursion? You should have seen their faces turn white :P Most of them knew that it's a function that calls itself, and only one mentionned that it can lead to a stack overflow... Too bad that noone provided any tips for solving them more efficient or mentionned <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Wilhelm_Ackermann">Wilhelm Ackerman<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
<p>I was a bit surprised by the poor answers on recursion so i decided not to ask them what a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wiktionary.org&#47;wiki&#47;semaphore">semaphore<&#47;a> or a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.webopedia.com&#47;TERM&#47;M&#47;mutex.html">mutex<&#47;a> are...<&#47;p></p>
<p><b>My Advise:<&#47;b> If you mention any skills make sure they are actually skills... And if you are interested in a maintenance job, stay at home and don't waste our valuable time. We'll get back to you. Goodbye.<&#47;p></p>
