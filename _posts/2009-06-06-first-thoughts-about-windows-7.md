<p>It is almost two years ago that i decided to <a href="http://www.timvw.be/about-the-wow-i-removed-vista-from-my-harddisk-experience/">uninstall Vista</a> after a bad first impression. Nowadays i have learned to live with it, but i guess i will never understand what all the fuss was about.</p>

<p>I can imagine that the marketing department will generate a lot of noise about Windows 7 but i am not convinced that there are actually people waiting for yet another OS. Anyway, i installed Windows 7 somewhere last week and i must say that i am pretty pleased with it. I guess that you didn't see that one coming, do you? Me, finally liking an operation system that comes from Microsoft ;-)</p>

<p>PS: Forgot to mention that i do not like the fact that i can not have Windows Virtual PC and Virtual Server 2005 at the same time :/</p>
