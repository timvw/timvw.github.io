<p><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/prj/ship-it">Ship It!: A Practical Guide to Successful Software Projects</a> is focussed on one core idea: "The List". The place in which you track your (and your teams) to-do and done work. I do not agree with everything written in the book but would still want to recommend it.</p>
