<p>Earlier today i exported the list with blogs i read from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sage.mozdev.org&#47;">Sage<&#47;a> and tried to import them into <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wordpress.org">WordPress<&#47;a>. Although all the entries had been processed but none of them appeared. Apparently you have to rename the xmlUrl attribute to htmlUrl in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;OPML">OPML<&#47;a> file. With Vim that's as simple as ":%s&#47;xmlUrl&#47;htmlUrl&#47;g".<&#47;p></p>
<p>Anyway, feel free to see if you find anything interesting in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.timvw.be&#47;wp-links-opml.php">list of blogs i'm reading<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
