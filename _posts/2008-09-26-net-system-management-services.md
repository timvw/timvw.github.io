<p>Earlier this week i finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/System-Management-Services-Alexander-Golomshtok/dp/1590590589">.NET System Management Services</a>. Although the book was published back in 2003, it still contains a lot of useful information on using the classes in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.aspx">System.Management</a> namespace. I did not like the fact that the author really made the effort to explain each line of code in the book. On the other hand, the book contains a lot of useful tips that help with writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation">WMI</a> queries, generating managed classes around WMI classes (and objects) and even applications that query <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol">SNMP</a> via WMI. All in all, i can recommend the book if you are going to use the System.Management API.</p>
