<p>Earlier at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/TechEd2008/default.mspx">Tech Ed North America</a> i heared how <a href="">Jesse Kaplan</a>, program Manager for Extensibility and add-ins for the CLR team, announced a new tool to help us with PInvoke signatures. Today i noticed that the tool, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/clrinterop">PInvoke Interop Assistant</a> has now been made available at CodePlex.</p>
