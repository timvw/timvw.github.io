Earlier at [Tech Ed North America](http://www.microsoft.com/events/TechEd2008/default.mspx) i heared how [Jesse Kaplan](), program Manager for Extensibility and add-ins for the CLR team, announced a new tool to help us with PInvoke signatures. Today i noticed that the tool, [PInvoke Interop Assistant](http://www.codeplex.com/clrinterop) has now been made available at CodePlex.
