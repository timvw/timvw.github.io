    I created StatLight for our continuous integration needs. You can check it out at www.statlight.net.

    StatLight will run the tests in the browser, where it can give you a true representation of what is actually going to happen in the browser. StatLight will also work with NUnit if you wish.

    Happy Testing!

<p>A while ago i was looking for a unittesting framework that can be used with Silverlight. Because i don't want to launch a webbrowser on my buildserver i ruled the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.msdn.microsoft.com&#47;silverlightut&#47;">Unit Test Framework for Microsoft Silverlight<&#47;a> out. A couple of websearches later i decided to try a Silverlight port of good ol' NUnit, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;nunitsilverlight&#47;">nunitsilverlight<&#47;a>, and was pretty pleased with results.<&#47;p></p>
<p>A couple of things to keep in mind though:<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your test runner loads the correct System assembly (Possible solution: set Copy Local to true in your test project)<&#47;li>
<li>In case your test runner has to run tests in both 'regular' and 'silverlight' assemblies, make sure that your runner uses separate AppDomains (For NUnit use the &#47;Domain=Multiple option)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
