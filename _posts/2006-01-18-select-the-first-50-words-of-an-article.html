<p>I'm cleaning up my code snippets and i found the following little trick in one of them that i've removed. Assuming that different words are separated by spaces we can use <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dev.mysql.com&#47;doc&#47;refman&#47;5.0&#47;en&#47;string-functions.html">SUBSTRING_INDEX<&#47;a> as following:<&#47;p><br />
[code lang="sql"]<br />
SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(body,' ',50) AS dn FROM mytable<br />
[&#47;code]</p>
