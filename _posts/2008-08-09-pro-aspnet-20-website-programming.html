<p>A couple of weeks ago i've read <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Pro-ASP-NET-2-0-Website-Programming&#47;dp&#47;1590595467">Pro ASP.NET 2.0 Website Programming<&#47;a>. The book contains a couple of nice ideas. I really appreciated the recommendation to use parameter binding when you manually compose queries. My biggest disappointment lies in the fact that the book doesn't practice what it preaches. Many code samples use a stringbuilder to generate sql queriers :(<&#47;p></p>
