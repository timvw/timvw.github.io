<p>I believe it was at an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.altdotnet.be">Alt.Net<&#47;a> meeting that the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Enterprise-Service-Bus-David-Chappell&#47;dp&#47;0596006756">Enterprise Service Bus<&#47;a> book was mentionned and i recently decided to give it a read. This book covers everything there is to know about an ESB. From a developer point of view it can serve as a good introduction to the core components and applied patterns but nothing more.<&#47;p></p>
