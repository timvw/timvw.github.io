<p>For some reason i was <a href="https:&#47;&#47;connect.microsoft.com&#47;VisualStudio&#47;feedback&#47;ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=464203">unable to insert a breakpoint by clicking next to the line number<&#47;a> in VS2010. Anyway, here is the trick that made the problem disappear for me: Go to "Tools > Import and export settings... " and choose "Reset all settings".<&#47;p></p>
