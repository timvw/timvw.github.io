<p>I've noticed there are still a lot of shows on television that want you to find a word. So i wrote a little wordfinder that does this for you using the ispell wordlist. As always, you can download the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.timvw.be&#47;wp-content&#47;code&#47;php&#47;wordfinder.txt">wordfinder.txt<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
