<p>Because i really enjoyed <a href="http://www.timvw.be/managing-humans-biting-and-humorous-tales-of-a-software-engineering-manager/">managing humans</a> i bought another book mentionned by Joel Spolsky: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Iconoclast-Neuroscientist-Reveals-Think-Differently/dp/1422115011/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1247393811&sr=8-1">Iconoclast: A Neuroscientist Reveals How to Think Differently</a>. This book would be an excellent read at the pool on a holiday location, but at home it was nothing more than an entertaining read. Not really recommended.</p>
