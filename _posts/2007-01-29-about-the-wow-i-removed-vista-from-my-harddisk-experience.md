A couple of weeks ago i decided to install Vista Ultimate... Despite the marketing efforts my only [Wow](http://www.experiencethewow.be/) experience was yesterday when i decided to remove it... (Simply boot with your XP installation cd, run fixboot and fixmbr from the rescue console and you're set ;))
