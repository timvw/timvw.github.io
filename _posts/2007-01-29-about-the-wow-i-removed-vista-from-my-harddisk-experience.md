<p>A couple of weeks ago i decided to install Vista Ultimate... Despite the marketing efforts my only <a href="http://www.experiencethewow.be/">Wow</a>  experience was yesterday when i decided to remove it... (Simply boot with your XP installation cd, run fixboot and fixmbr from the rescue console and you're set ;))</p>
