For a couple of days now i've been pondering about posting something about my love for [GNU text-utilities](http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/) but never got round to it. A couple of minutes ago i read Phil Windley's [Using Grep and Find](http://www.windley.com/archives/2009/03/using_grep_and_find.shtml) post so here is a one-liner that shows how you can add a reference to a msbuild target file to all csproj files in a given folder:

```bash
find -name *.csproj -exec sed -i -e '#^</project>$# <import Project="X:\\BuildTasks\\Corp.targets" />\r\n</project>' {} \;
```

Or if you are frustrated with System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttributes and want to remove them from all your cs files:

```bash
find -name \*.cs -exed sed -r -i -e 's#\[.\*?SuppressMessage.*?\]##' {} \";
```
