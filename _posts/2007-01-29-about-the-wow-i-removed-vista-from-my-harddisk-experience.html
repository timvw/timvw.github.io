    Tough Titties, I'm starting to be a Vista fan. If I compare vista with XP tablet edition, It really is 10 times better for a TC device. (Currently owning: HP TC 4400) (specially in combination with Onenote 2007 (and office2007 offcourse))

    At least you can share your "wow, i had to remove vista from my harddisk because ..." arguments, no? ;-)

    I just haven't found a reason to actually use Vista... Not having a graphics card that supports aero, not having a running Visual Studio and not having a working VPN connection are the main reasons i decided to go back to good old XP. I'm pretty sure these problems will be solved and there will even come a time when i'm more or less forced to start using Vista... But i don't expect to see it happen the first few months though...

    Btw, i really do like Office2K7...


    PS: A while ago, might be a couple of years now :D, you were right when you said that an msdn subscription is really sweet (unlike the msdn aa crap i reported about back then)).

    long live MSDN subscriptions! :)

    Aero is nice but no fun with 'old' applications that aren't supported. I'm  getting tired of my screen 'flashing' all the time because some applications aren't supported. Symantec VPN also doens't work, a bummer indeed. But i still haven't go any problems with my visual studio 2005 on my pc. (but then again,... i'm not a heavy heavy Visual studio user...)

    Anywayz..... I don't think i will advise our company deploying vista in business environments soon... I just don't see vista working for all those dummy users out there. (with all do respect for the dummy users! ;p) I'm really puzzled about how we are going to handle this one... For some XP was hard enough... Same about office2k7, i don't think it's possible for the regular user to adapt to those new software's without a few days of training.

<p>A couple of weeks ago i decided to install Vista Ultimate... Despite the marketing efforts my only <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.experiencethewow.be&#47;">Wow<&#47;a>  experience was yesterday when i decided to remove it... (Simply boot with your XP installation cd, run fixboot and fixmbr from the rescue console and you're set ;))<&#47;p></p>
