<p>Last week i have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Server-Period-Computer-Security/dp/1931836124">The Best Damn Windows Server 2003 Book Period</a>. Although the book contains some interesting guidance i became annoyed with the fact that the book is overloaded with screenshots. Without those screenshots this book would contain around 250 interesting pages.</p>
