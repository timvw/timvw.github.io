<p>This is probably one of the shortest book reviews ever, but there is not much to say about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;Nomadic-Developer-Surviving-Technology-Consulting&#47;dp&#47;0321606396">The Nomadic Developer: Surviving and Thriving in the World of Technology Consulting<&#47;a>. Just read it if you are (or considering to become) an IT-consultant because it really covers both good and bad aspects in depth.<&#47;p></p>
