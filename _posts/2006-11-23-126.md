<p>Earlier this week i was a bit surprised that the following code compiled without errors or warning messages. I expected at least a warning that i was trying to assign a double value to an integer parameter:</p>
[code lang="csharp"]static void Main(string[] args)
{
 double[] values = new double[] { 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5 };

 Console.WriteLine("foreach with int:");

 // happily iterate over the double values as if they are ints...
 // this outputs the lines 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
 foreach (int value in values)
 {
  Console.WriteLine(value);
 }
}[/code]
<p>So i decided to dive into the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-334.pdf">C# Language Specification</a> (Section 15.8.4 The foreach statement) where i found the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>
A foreach statement of the form foreach (V v in x) embedded-statement is then expanded to:
[code lang="csharp"]
{
 E e = ((C)(x)).GetEnumerator();
 try {
  V v;
  while (e.MoveNext()) {
   v = (V)(T)e.Current;
   embedded-statement
  }
 }
 finally {
  â€¦ // Dispose e
 }
}
[/code]
</div>
