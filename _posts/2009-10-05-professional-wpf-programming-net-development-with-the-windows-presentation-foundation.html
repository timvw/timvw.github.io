<p>I am very disappointed with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;Professional-WPF-Programming-Development-Presentation&#47;dp&#47;0470041803">Professional WPF Programming: NET Development with the Windows Presentation Foundation<&#47;a>. Apart from the two chapters that cover Expression Blend i found nothing worth reading in this book. This is probably the last Wrox book that i buy.<&#47;p></p>
