<p>The WordPress documentation says that you have to call add_action('activate_pluginurl', 'somefunction') to trigger somefunction when your plugin is activated. Unfortunately i couldn't find with what pluginurl should be replaced. After a bit of experimenting i've found that in wp-admin&#47;plugins.php the following is called when a plugin is activated:<&#47;p></p>
<p>[code lang="php"]<br />
do_action('activate_' . trim( $_GET['plugin'] ));<br />
[&#47;code]</p>
<p>So it appears that you simply have to use the path of your plugin relative to &#47;wp-content&#47;plugins. Eg: you have a plugin in &#47;wp-content&#47;plugins&#47;wp-spamfilter&#47;wp-spamfilter.php then you have to call add_action as following:<&#47;p></p>
<p>[code lang="php"]<br />
add_action('activate_wp-spamfilter&#47;wp-spamfilter.php', 'somefunction');<br />
[&#47;code]</p>
