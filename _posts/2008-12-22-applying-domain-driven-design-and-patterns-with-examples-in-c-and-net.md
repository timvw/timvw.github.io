In his book, [Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# and .NET](http://www.amazon.com/Applying-Domain-Driven-Design-Patterns-Examples/dp/0321268202), Jimmy Nilsson covers the most common questions you ask yourself when you are thinking about applying DDD to one of your projects. Sometimes i found the ordering of the chapters a bit odd but all in all it was an excellent read and most certainly recommended.
