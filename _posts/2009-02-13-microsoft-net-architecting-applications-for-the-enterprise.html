<p>Earlier this month i have read <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Microsoft%C2%AE-NET-Architecting-Applications-PRO-Developer&#47;dp&#47;073562609X">Microsoft .NET: Architecting Applications for the Enterprise<&#47;a>. This time i was pretty pleased to notice that the author, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;despos&#47;">Dino Esposito<&#47;a>, did not fill the book with references to other books written by him. All in all the book painted a pretty accurate picture of enterprise application development that is obviously inspired by masterworks like: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional&#47;dp&#47;0201633612">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature&#47;dp&#47;0321127420">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software&#47;dp&#47;0321125215">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
<p>One remark though: I was a bit disappointed to see that the examples of unit tests used MSTEST. Why? Because it is such a broken product i find it hard to believe that for serious enterprise application development this library is actually usable.<&#47;p></p>
