<p>Sometimes you run into a situations where a given task spawns a separate thread and completes it's work on that separate thread. Eg: sending a bit XMLA to SQL Server Analysis Services with Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Deployment.exe and then waiting for the processing to be completed. Anyway, here is a simple function that will wait untill a given file exists:<&#47;p></p>
<p>[code lang="powershell"]<br />
function WaitForFile($File) {<br />
 while(!(Test-Path $File)) {<br />
  Start-Sleep -s 10;<br />
 }<br />
}<br />
[&#47;code]</p>
