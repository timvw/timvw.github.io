<p>Earlier this week my build failed because maven was not able to resolve an (indirect) dependency on some package. It took me a while to notice that the dependency node in the pom file had an extra attribute: type = bundle. It only took a couple of minutes to find a good explanation <a href="http:&#47;&#47;stackoverflow.com&#47;questions&#47;14913615&#47;osgi-bundle-vs-jar-dependency">here<&#47;a>. Build fixed ;)<&#47;p></p>
