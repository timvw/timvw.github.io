<p>A while ago we had a session on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.altdotnet.be&#47;14&#47;section.aspx&#47;16">messaging<&#47;a> at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.altdotnet.be&#47;">ALT.NET Belgium<&#47;a> and it was then that i decided i should order my copy of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Addison-Wesley&#47;dp&#47;0321200683">Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions<&#47;a>. I found first half of the book pretty interesting but got bored around chapter 8 and skipped some sections from there. All in all this book this book is pretty good and if you know a thing or two about TCP&#47;IP implementations you might even recognize some patterns in a different problem space.<&#47;p></p>
