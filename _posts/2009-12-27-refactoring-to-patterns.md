<p>Earlier this month i ordered my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Patterns-Joshua-Kerievsky/dp/0321213351">Refactoring to Patterns</a>. This books has two parts: the first part describes patterns and code smells (anti-patterns) and the second part is a catalog of refactorings. The first part is not bad, but i appreciated the second part much more. I did not read the book from front to cover and skipped the 'mechanics' sections (abstract steps to take in order to accomplish a particular refactoring). I focussed on the 'example' sections instead which demonstrate the application of the previously mentionned mechanics.</p>

<p>During the reading of this book i had a couple of 'aha' moments which gave me the feeling that i understood (appreciated) a certain pattern better. All in all a good book to read.</p>
