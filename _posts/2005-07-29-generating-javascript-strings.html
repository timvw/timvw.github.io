<p>Well, I've always experienced the generating JavaScript strings with PHP as a PITA. An example, which requires you to take care of the escaping of quotes, is the string: 'O'Reilly has nice books'. Today i had this brilliant idea to do it as following:<&#47;p><br />
[code lang="php"]<?php<br />
$str = addslashes("Hello peter's cats");<br />
echo "<script type='text&#47;javascript'>";<br />
echo "alert('$str')";<br />
echo "";<br />
?>[&#47;code]</p>
