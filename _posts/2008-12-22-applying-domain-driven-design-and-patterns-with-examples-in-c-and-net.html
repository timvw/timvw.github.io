<p>In his book, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Applying-Domain-Driven-Design-Patterns-Examples&#47;dp&#47;0321268202">Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# and .NET<&#47;a>, Jimmy Nilsson covers the most common questions you ask yourself when you are thinking about applying DDD to one of your projects. Sometimes i found the ordering of the chapters a bit odd but all in all it was an excellent read and most certainly recommended.<&#47;p></p>
