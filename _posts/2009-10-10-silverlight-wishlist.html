<p>Here are the features that i would love to see in Silverlight:<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to copy text from the UI (Or was the UX argument an excuse for playing with new toys?)<&#47;li>
<li>MSTEST (I know that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.msdn.microsoft.com&#47;silverlightut&#47;">Silverlight Unit Test Framework <&#47;a> exists.)<&#47;li>
<li>Triggers (including data triggers)<&#47;li>
<li>Typed data templates<&#47;li>
<li>Uniform XAML (WPF: <Style TargetType={x:Type local:Foo}&#47;> vs Silverlight: <Style TargetType={local:Foo}&#47;>)<&#47;li>
<li>Uniform validation API (eg: Data Annotations has three flavors)<&#47;li>
<li>XAML with less namespaces (doesn't really matter if you're a designer only type)<&#47;li>
<li>Support for Desktop ('regular') .NET assemblies. As long as Desktop .NET assemblies are not supported, tools that automate the process of generating a 'shadow' .Silverlight project (eg: Prism has for each project a silverlight project that, ignoring the different assembly references, exists out of file references to the orginal project).<&#47;li>
<li>UniformGrid<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Note: This list is not exhaustive and may change in the future.<&#47;p></p>
