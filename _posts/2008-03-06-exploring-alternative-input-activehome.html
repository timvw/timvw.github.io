<p>A while ago i bought <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.easycomputing.com&#47;product.asp?ref=3655">Media Centerkit<&#47;a> for an euro or two. I wouldn't recommend the product because it comes with crappy software. Anyway, i was only interested in playing with the hardware (RF Remote and USB Receiver) so i downloaded the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.activehomepro.com&#47;sdk&#47;sdk-info.html">ActiveHome Professional SDK<&#47;a>. Once you install this you can add a reference to "ActiveHomeScript 1.0 Type Library" under the COM tab in Visual Studio. I wrote a little library so that i can consume the ActiveHomeClass.RecvAction in a Type-safe way:<&#47;p><br />

<p>Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can use the Notifier to receive Notifications:<&#47;p><br />
[code lang="csharp"]<br />
&#47;&#47; register our eventhandler and tell the notifier to start raising events<br />
Notifier.Instance.NotificationReceived += this.Instance_NotificationReceived;<br />
Notifier.Instance.Enable();</p>
<p>private void Instance_NotificationReceived(object sender, NotificationReceivedEventArgs e)<br />
{<br />
 &#47;&#47; for more complex logic i would recommend that you apply a Filter pattern...<br />
 RadioFrequencyNotification rfNotification = e.Notification as RadioFrequencyNotification;<br />
 if (rfNotification.IsKeyPressed)<br />
 {<br />
  if (rfNotification.Command == RadioFrequencyCommand.Menu)<br />
  {<br />
   this.RaiseToolStripMenuItemClicked(this.MenuClicked, EventArgs.Empty);<br />
  }<br />
 }<br />
}[&#47;code]</p>
<p>As always feel free to download the library and sample application: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.timvw.be&#47;wp-content&#47;code&#47;csharp&#47;ActiveHome.zip">ActiveHome.zip<&#47;a><&#47;p></p>
