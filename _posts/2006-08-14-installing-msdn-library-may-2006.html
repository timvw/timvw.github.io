  content: A bit late, but I had the same problem. I was using Microsoft&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    Virtual CD tool, and mounting all three images (as Z, Y, and X respectively, because
    that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the order it adds drives in), and it would say it can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    find Y:\_17693_etc., and I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d have to cancel the installation.
    It seems the problem was I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d mounted all three at once. When
    I tried using the Z drive and mounting and ejecting them individually, it worked
    fine. It even asked me to insert the next CD.

    Just found the solution. Copy the entire contents of all 3 ISOs into one
    > directory (answering yes to all overwrite queries). Then just run the VS
    > setup, select the directory, and everything seems to install normally.

<p>Today i downloaded the freely available <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;downloads&#47;details.aspx?FamilyId=373930CB-A3D7-4EA5-B421-DD6818DC7C41&displaylang=en">MSDN Library (May 2006 Edition)<&#47;a>. I appended .iso to the filenames and mounted the first image with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ww2.nero.com&#47;nero6&#47;eng&#47;Nero_ImageDrive_prev.html">Nero ImageDrive<&#47;a>. After a while i got the following error message: "Source file not found: _17693_RTL_x86_enu_NET_Framework_SDK_HxS.cab".<&#47;p><br />

<p>Apparently this file exists on the second disk (Why doesn't the installer ask me to insert the second disk?). And yes, a little while later the same thing happens again when the third disk is expected....<&#47;p></p>
