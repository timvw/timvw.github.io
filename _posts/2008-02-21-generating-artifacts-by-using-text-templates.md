Since i remember myself thinking "I should look up that .tt templating thing" already a couple of times and always forgot to actually do so, i'm posting it here: [Generating Artifacts By Using Text Templates](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx). The tools comes with the [Visual Studio SDK](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb166441(VS.80).aspx).
