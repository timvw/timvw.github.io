<p>There were days that i didn't like XSL because it seemed to be impossible to insert a value inside an attribute. For example:<&#47;p></p>
<p>[code lang="xml"]</p>
<form action="<xsl:value-of select="&#47;page&#47;action"&#47;>" method="post"><br />
[&#47;code]</p>
<p>Today i've seen that other people also struggle with this issue. So here is the solution:<&#47;p></p>
<p>[code lang="xml"]</p>
<form action="{&#47;page&#47;action}" method="post">
<&#47;form>[&#47;code]</p>
