I believe it was at an [Alt.Net](http://www.altdotnet.be) meeting that the [Enterprise Service Bus](http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Service-Bus-David-Chappell/dp/0596006756) book was mentionned and i recently decided to give it a read. This book covers everything there is to know about an ESB. From a developer point of view it can serve as a good introduction to the core components and applied patterns but nothing more.
