<p>I believe it was at an <a href="http://www.altdotnet.be">Alt.Net</a> meeting that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Service-Bus-David-Chappell/dp/0596006756">Enterprise Service Bus</a> book was mentionned and i recently decided to give it a read. This book covers everything there is to know about an ESB. From a developer point of view it can serve as a good introduction to the core components and applied patterns but nothing more.</p>
