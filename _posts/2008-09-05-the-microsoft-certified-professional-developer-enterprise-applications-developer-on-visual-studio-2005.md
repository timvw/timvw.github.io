Not that anyone should care, apart from my manager, i [posted](http://www.timvw.be/mcts/) that the only remaining exam was [070-549](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exams/70-549.mspx) PRO: Designing and Developing Enterprise Applications by Using the Microsoft .NET Framework a while ago. And this morning i passed that exam ðŸ™‚ This means that i have earned the "[MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx)" certificate that demonstrates that i have the comprehensive skills required to build n-tier solutions that target both Web and client user experiences.

At this moment i am quite involved in a couple of projects using WCF and WF thus it is quite possible that i decide to take the upgrade path to [MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/vstudio/2008/default.mspx) later on this year.
