<p>Not that anyone should care, apart from my manager,  i <a href="http://www.timvw.be/mcts/">posted</a> that the only remaining exam was <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exams/70-549.mspx">070-549</a> PRO: Designing and Developing Enterprise Applications by Using the Microsoft .NET Framework a while ago. And this morning i passed that exam :) This means that i have earned the "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx">MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer</a>" certificate that demonstrates that i have the comprehensive skills required to build n-tier solutions that target both Web and client user experiences.</p>
<p>At this moment i am quite involved in a couple of projects using WCF and WF thus it is quite possible that i decide to take the upgrade path to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/vstudio/2008/default.mspx">MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer 3.5</a> later on this year.</p>
