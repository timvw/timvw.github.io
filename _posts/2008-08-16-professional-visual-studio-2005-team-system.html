<p>I received my copy of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Professional-Visual-Studio-System-Programmer&#47;dp&#47;0764584367">Professional Visual Studio 2005 Team System<&#47;a> at a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.visug.be">Visug<&#47;a> event but i can't say that i found it really interesting. It is simply impossible to cover everything on Team System in one book.<&#47;p></p>
