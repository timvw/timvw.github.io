<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pragprog.com&#47;titles&#47;prj&#47;ship-it">Ship It!: A Practical Guide to Successful Software Projects<&#47;a> is focussed on one core idea: "The List". The place in which you track your (and your teams) to-do and done work. I do not agree with everything written in the book but would still want to recommend it.<&#47;p></p>
