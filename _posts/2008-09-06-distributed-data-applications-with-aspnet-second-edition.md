Last week i finally got round to reading [Distributed Data Applications with ASP.NET, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590593189/). The book was written in 2004 and handles technologies like [HTML Applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application) and [XMLHttpRequest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest). Although the book is loaded with code, it also contains plenty of reasoning behind the choice of one approach over another which made me appreciate the book. Definitely worth the 1.5 euros i paid for it.
