<p>You are probably wondering what all these short book reviews are all about. A little longer than two years ago i graduated and became a passionate .NET developer. During these two years i have learned quite a lot (only to find out that there is so much more out there that i know nothing about). Under <a href="http://www.timvw.be/category/book-reviews/">Book reviews</a> you can find a list of books that have found a place on my bookshelf the last two years. Despite the reading of numerous e-books, articles and blog posts combined with a good portion of experiments i still have the feeling that i have got some catching up to do. Sigh. (Luckily enough i do realize that this is a feeling that will never go away when you have a job in information technology.)</p>
