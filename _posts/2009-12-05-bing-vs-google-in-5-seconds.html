<p>A while ago i sat in a meeting and some ms-fanboy used <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bing.com">Bing<&#47;a> to find out how much 60 inches were in meters. The first page had pages with conversion factors but none of them contained the actual answer. I suggested that he'd use <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com">Google<&#47;a> instead and while he was keying in the question the answer already appeared.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Today i wanted to make a screencast of this difference in experience but it seems that bing has the 'conversion' feature now too. Wondering about what would make me switch search engines...<&#47;p></p>
