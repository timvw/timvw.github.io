<p>A while ago i heared Joel Spolsky shamelessly promote <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering&#47;dp&#47;159059844X">Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager<&#47;a> and decided to give it a read. No boring process descriptions, but short and consice chapters, fed with real life examples, transmitting the message to the reader. I loved reading this book.<&#47;p></p>
