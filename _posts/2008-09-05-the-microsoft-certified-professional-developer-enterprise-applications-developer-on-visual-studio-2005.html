<p>Not that anyone should care, apart from my manager,  i <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.timvw.be&#47;mcts&#47;">posted<&#47;a> that the only remaining exam was <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;learning&#47;en&#47;us&#47;exams&#47;70-549.mspx">070-549<&#47;a> PRO: Designing and Developing Enterprise Applications by Using the Microsoft .NET Framework a while ago. And this morning i passed that exam :) This means that i have earned the "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;learning&#47;mcp&#47;mcpd&#47;entapp&#47;default.mspx">MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer<&#47;a>" certificate that demonstrates that i have the comprehensive skills required to build n-tier solutions that target both Web and client user experiences.<&#47;p></p>
<p>At this moment i am quite involved in a couple of projects using WCF and WF thus it is quite possible that i decide to take the upgrade path to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;learning&#47;mcp&#47;mcpd&#47;vstudio&#47;2008&#47;default.mspx">MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer 3.5<&#47;a> later on this year.<&#47;p></p>
