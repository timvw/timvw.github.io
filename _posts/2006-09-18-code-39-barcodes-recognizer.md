<p>Earlier today i read <a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2006/09/18/4432.aspx">Code 39 barcodes in C#</a> by <a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/default.aspx">Bart De Smet</a>. The article shows the reader how to generate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39">Code 39 barcode</a>. I thought it would be cool if you could actually recognize the barcode in the generated bitmaps so i last couple of hours i wrote a BarCode39 Reader :) Feel free to get <a href="http://www.timvw.be/wp-content/code/csharp/BarCode39Reader.zip">BarCode39Reader.zip</a>  sources now!(PS: I forgot to write this is still a very quick 'n dirty hack. I don't write bad code, just create a lot of opportunities to refactor ;)</p>
