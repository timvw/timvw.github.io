Earlier today i read [Code 39 barcodes in C#](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2006/09/18/4432.aspx) by [Bart De Smet](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/default.aspx). The article shows the reader how to generate a [Code 39 barcode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39). I thought it would be cool if you could actually recognize the barcode in the generated bitmaps so i last couple of hours i wrote a BarCode39 Reader ðŸ™‚ Feel free to get [BarCode39Reader.zip](http://www.timvw.be/wp-content/code/csharp/BarCode39Reader.zip) sources now!(PS: I forgot to write this is still a very quick 'n dirty hack. I don't write bad code, just create a lot of opportunities to refactor ðŸ˜‰
