<p>A while ago i was listening to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dotnetrocks.com&#47;default.aspx?showNum=436">'Kathleen Dollard on MEF and More' on NET Rocks!<&#47;a> and it got me thinking.<&#47;p></p>
<p>For a long time i considered code generation as a way to reduce the tedious parts of software development by spitting out considerable amounts of code and I immediately thought of tools like <a href="msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;bb126445.aspx">T4<&#47;a>: Text Template Transformation Toolkit and <a href="msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;teamsystem&#47;aa718948.aspx ">GAT<&#47;a>: Guidance Automation Toolkit.<&#47;p></p>
<p>I believe that in order to become more productive we need a solution that requires less code spitting by means of better frameworks and higher languages. Eg: C# allows us to think about computer instructions on a much higher level than assembly language.<&#47;p></p>
<p>And then i realised that the C# compiler is nothing more than a code generation tool!<&#47;p></p>
