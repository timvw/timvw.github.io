<p>As i already wrote, last couple of days i've been experimenting with PL&#47;SQL. At work we use <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.toadsoft.com&#47;toad_oracle.htm">Toad for Oracle<&#47;a> but since <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.toadsoft.com&#47;">TOADSoft<&#47;a> only offers a limited freeware version i decided to write my code with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.vim.org">GVim<&#47;a> and use <a href="http:&#47;&#47;orafaq.com&#47;faqplus.htm#WHAT">SQL*Plus<&#47;a> at home. Here are a couple of lines i added to my login.sql file:<&#47;p></p>
<p>[code lang="sql"]DEFINE _EDITOR='gvim -c "set filetype=sql"'<br />
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON<br />
SET LINESIZE 120<br />
SET AUTOCOMMIT OFF<br />
ALTER SESSION SET NLS_DATE_FORMAT='YYYY-MM-DD';[&#47;code]</p>
<p>In a stored procedure i created and filled an instance of NUMBER_TABLE (CREATE TYPE NUMBER_TABLE AS TABLE OF NUMBER) and my stored procedure tried to select all the rows in that table (SELECT * FROM V_NUMBER_TABLE). Apparently the engine didn't know this type @runtime despite the fact that i declared it in my stored procedure (V_NUMBER TABLE NUMBER_TABLE := NUMBER_TABLE();) and the engine compiled the package without errors. I got round that problem as following:<&#47;p></p>
<p>[code lang="sql"]SELECT * FROM (CAST(V_NUMBER_TABLE AS NUMBER_TABLE));[&#47;code]</p>
