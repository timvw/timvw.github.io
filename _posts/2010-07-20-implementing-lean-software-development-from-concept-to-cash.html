<p>Not going to waste time re-iterating what's in the book because you can find that here: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.poppendieck.com&#47;ilsd.htm">Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash<&#47;a>. Just make sure that you get your copy and read it from beginning to end. Afterwards you may want to hand it over to your manager ;)<&#47;p></p>
