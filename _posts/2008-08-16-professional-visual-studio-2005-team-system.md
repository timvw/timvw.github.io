I received my copy of [Professional Visual Studio 2005 Team System](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Visual-Studio-System-Programmer/dp/0764584367) at a [Visug](http://www.visug.be) event but i can't say that i found it really interesting. It is simply impossible to cover everything on Team System in one book.
