Visual Studio 2008 (SP1) crashed every time i tried to open a ViewPage with the Web Form Editor (designer). Kudos go to eniac who [suggested](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/09/05/mvcfutures-and-asp.net-mvc-beta.aspx) the removal of the [Power Commands](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands) add-in. This made the crashes disappear.
