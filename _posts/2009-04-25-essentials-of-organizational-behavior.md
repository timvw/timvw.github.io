Somewhere in 2007 I started reading [Essentials of Organizational Behavior](http://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Organizational-Behavior-Stephen-Robbins/dp/0136077617/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1240060292&sr=8-2) and only finished it earlier this week. This book covers behavior of humans, humans in organizations, and organizations. Although the book covers the topics pretty well i must say that i liked Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager more.
