<p>Earlier today i decided to add an image to my VMWare Server. The creation of the image went smooth but at the end of the process i recieved the following error: <b>Unable to add virtual machine 'E:\\.....' to the inventory: Virtual machine is already in the inventory".<&#47;b> When i tried to open the machine via File > Open i recieved the error again. Here is a workaround for this problem: Choose 'View' in the menubar and click on Inventory F9. At the left of the screen you'll see a list of machines that are in the Inventory. If you delete the entries (right click on the machines in the list and choose delete) you'll be able to Open your newly created machine :)<&#47;p></p>
