<p>Having heared only positive things about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/">Dino Esposito</a>'s way of writing i decided to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Microsoft-ASP-NET-Dino-Esposito/dp/0735625271">Programming Microsoft ASP.NET 3.5</a>. The book is written in a way that invites you to read and experiment with the contents. It covered the essentials of ASP.NET programming but i did not have the feeling that it added much to what i had read in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-ASP-NET-2-0-Programmer/dp/0764576100">Professional ASP.NET 2.0</a>. After a while i became annoyed with the numerous references to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735621772/sr=1-1/qid=1156801743/ref=sr_1_1/104-6313703-3867159?ie=UTF8&s=books">Programming Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 Applications: Advanced Topics</a>.</p>
