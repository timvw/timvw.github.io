<p>Earlier this week i finished reading <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;System-Management-Services-Alexander-Golomshtok&#47;dp&#47;1590590589">.NET System Management Services<&#47;a>. Although the book was published back in 2003, it still contains a lot of useful information on using the classes in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.management.aspx">System.Management<&#47;a> namespace. I did not like the fact that the author really made the effort to explain each line of code in the book. On the other hand, the book contains a lot of useful tips that help with writing <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Windows_Management_Instrumentation">WMI<&#47;a> queries, generating managed classes around WMI classes (and objects) and even applications that query <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nl.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Simple_Network_Management_Protocol">SNMP<&#47;a> via WMI. All in all, i can recommend the book if you are going to use the System.Management API.<&#47;p></p>
