<p>The first part of the book covers some tools that may improve your productivity (but nothing that i did not use already). The second part covers development techniques (again, nothing new under the sun). Despite the author's intentions i found reading <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596519544">The Productive Programmer</a> a disappointment.</p>
