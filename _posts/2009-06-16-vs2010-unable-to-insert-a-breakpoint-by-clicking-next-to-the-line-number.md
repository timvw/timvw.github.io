<p>For some reason i was <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=464203">unable to insert a breakpoint by clicking next to the line number</a> in VS2010. Anyway, here is the trick that made the problem disappear for me: Go to "Tools > Import and export settings... " and choose "Reset all settings".</p>
