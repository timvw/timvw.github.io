Last days i've visited a couple of interesting sessions at the [Developer & IT Pro Days 2007](http://www.microsoft.com/belux/devitprodays/). All in all the event was pretty well organised... In the closing word of the event, [Chad Z. Hower](http://blogs.msdn.com/czhower/) found himself quite funny when he set the title of a form in an exception throwing application to 'Java Application'. Unlike the rest of the crowd i didn't see the humor in it... Anyway, when his Visual Studio Orcas started choking i wet my pants too ðŸ˜‰
