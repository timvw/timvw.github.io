<p>Last days i've visited a couple of interesting sessions at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/devitprodays/">Developer & IT Pro Days 2007</a>. All in all the event was pretty well organised... In the closing word of the event, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/czhower/">Chad Z. Hower</a> found himself quite funny when he set the title of a form in an exception throwing application to 'Java Application'. Unlike the rest of the crowd i didn't see the humor in it...   Anyway, when his Visual Studio Orcas started choking i wet my pants too ;)</p>
