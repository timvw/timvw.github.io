This is probably one of the shortest book reviews ever, but there is not much to say about [The Nomadic Developer: Surviving and Thriving in the World of Technology Consulting](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nomadic-Developer-Surviving-Technology-Consulting/dp/0321606396). Just read it if you are (or considering to become) an IT-consultant because it really covers both good and bad aspects in depth.
