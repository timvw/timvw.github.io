<p>Last week i received my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/NHibernate-Action-Pierre-Henri-Kuat%C3%A9/dp/1932394923">NHibernate in Action</a>. This book provides much more than the typical examples you find in the product documentation like architectural guidance on the application of O/R Mapping. Even with my Hibernate experience i found some interesting insights in the NHibernate features. This book is most certainly recommended!</p>
