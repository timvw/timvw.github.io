<p>I am very disappointed with <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Professional-WPF-Programming-Development-Presentation/dp/0470041803">Professional WPF Programming: NET Development with the Windows Presentation Foundation</a>. Apart from the two chapters that cover Expression Blend i found nothing worth reading in this book. This is probably the last Wrox book that i buy.</p>
