  content: It was not easy stopping Ronald, was it? :)

<p>Earlier this evening i visited "Visual C++ 'Orcas' and a Microsoft C++ Strategy", an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;belux&#47;msdn&#47;nl&#47;default.mspx">MSDN Belux<&#47;a> event. Since the events are for free, time would be the only thing you can loose.... But as always with these events, they are worth the time. I even liked the jokes this time ;)) The speaker, Ronald Laeremans, now the Program Unit Manager for Visual C++ talked and kept talking about his passion :) 30 minutes after his session <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;tommer&#47;">Tom<&#47;a> eventually found a way to stop him.. I can only recommend that you visit these events too... Scheduled:<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>May 10th, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.visug.be&#47;Default.aspx">Introduction on IIS7<&#47;a> (I won't be there since i already saw the presentation at DevDays)<&#47;li>
<li>June 6th, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;msevents.microsoft.com&#47;CUI&#47;EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032340308&Culture=en-US">Securing ASP.NET AJAX enabled web applications, lessons from the field<&#47;a><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
