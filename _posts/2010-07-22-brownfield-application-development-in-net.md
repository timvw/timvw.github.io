[Brownfield Application Development in .NET](http://www.manning.com/baley/) is one of the better books i have read recently. The first part is about the ecosystem (version control, automated build, continuous integration, testing, defect management, ... ), the second part is about the code (OO-principles, layering, dependencies, ui patterns, ...) and the last chapter talks about ways to maintain the momentum. Very much recommended!
