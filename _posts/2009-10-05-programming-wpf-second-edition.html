<p>I felt it was time to get up to speed with WPF so i decided to buy <a href="http:&#47;&#47;oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;9780596510374">Programming WPF, Second edition<&#47;a>. This book answered a lot of my  newbie questions (where is the application entry point etc) right from the start. I liked it so much that i decided to read a second time ;) Most definitely recommended.<&#47;p></p>
