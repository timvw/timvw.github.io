A while ago i noticed that more and more of my work is related to coaching and managing other developers. In order to become better at that i ordered my copy of [Manage It!: Your Guide to Modern Pragmatic Project Management](http://pragprog.com/titles/jrpm/manage-it). A book with plenty of useful (practical) tips. Definitely worth reading!
