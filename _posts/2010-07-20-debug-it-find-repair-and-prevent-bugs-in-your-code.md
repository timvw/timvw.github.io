A while ago i noticed that [Davy Brion](http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/01/highly-recommended-book-debug-it/) recommended [Debug It!: Find, Repair, and Prevent Bugs in Your Code](http://pragprog.com/titles/pbdp/debug-it) so i decided to give it a read. Although i really liked the suggested process for investigating bugs where you have absolutely no clue of what is going on, i am not convinced that this is a must read book.
