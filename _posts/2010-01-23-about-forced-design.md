> if you need typemock your design is wrong.

Although i understand what people are trying to say with that quote, it's wrong on many levels. I pretty much agree with everything that Roy wrote in [Test driven design â€“ Willed vs. Forced Designs](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2009/11/12/test-driven-design-willed-vs-forced-designs.aspx). As some commenters pointed out it is hard to convince management that they need an isolation framework, let alone that they have to pay for one.

A couple of thoughts:

  * What about Pex Stubs & Moles? It uses the profiling API (less limitations than rhino/moq/...) too and for a lot of shops doing .Net development it's free.
  * I really don't understand people that are unwilling to pay for tools that can contribute to the generation of business value (eg: Resharper, NCover, NDepend, ...) when they don't come from Microsoft.
  * Filling up gaps in the .Net/Microsoft space seems like an awful business model.
