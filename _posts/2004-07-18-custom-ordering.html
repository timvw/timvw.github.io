<p>Assume we have a fruits table. And we want to select all the fruits that have a red or orange or blue color. But we want the resultset to have first all the fruits with color=red, then the fruits with color=blue and then the fruits with color=orange. It's obvious we can't use an alphabetical order. Thus we have to introduce our own order relation.<&#47;p><br />
[code lang="sql"]<br />
select *<br />
from fruits<br />
where color = 'red' or color = 'blue' or color = 'orange'<br />
order by case<br />
when color = 'red' then 0<br />
when color = 'blue' then 1<br />
when color = 'orange' then 2<br />
end<br />
[&#47;code]</p>
