<p>I could not find a .NET implementation of the HMAC-Based One Time Password (HOTP) algorithm as specified in <a href="ftp:&#47;&#47;ftp.rfc-editor.org&#47;in-notes&#47;rfc4226.txt">RFC4226<&#47;a> so i decided to write one myself. Because the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ietf.org&#47;internet-drafts&#47;draft-mraihi-totp-timebased-00.txt">Time-Based OTP (TOTP)<&#47;a> algorithm is an application of HOTP, more specifically: TOTP = HOTP(K, T) with T = (Current Unix time - T0) &#47; Timestep, i have implemented that algorithm too.<&#47;p></p>
<p>You can find both Be.Timvw.Framework.Security.HmacOneTimePassword and Be.Timvw.Framework.Security.TimeOneTimePassword in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;BeTimvwFramework">BeTimvwFramework<&#47;a>. For more information about authentication i would recommend the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.openauthentication.org&#47;specifications">specifications and technicals resources<&#47;a> at the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.openauthentication.org&#47;">OATH<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
