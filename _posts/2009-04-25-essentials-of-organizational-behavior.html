<p>Somewhere in 2007 I started reading <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Essentials-Organizational-Behavior-Stephen-Robbins&#47;dp&#47;0136077617&#47;ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1240060292&sr=8-2">Essentials of Organizational Behavior<&#47;a> and only finished it earlier this week. This book covers behavior of humans, humans in organizations, and organizations. Although the book covers the topics pretty well i must say that i liked Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager more.<&#47;p></p>
