<p>Because i really enjoyed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.timvw.be&#47;managing-humans-biting-and-humorous-tales-of-a-software-engineering-manager&#47;">managing humans<&#47;a> i bought another book mentionned by Joel Spolsky: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Iconoclast-Neuroscientist-Reveals-Think-Differently&#47;dp&#47;1422115011&#47;ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1247393811&sr=8-1">Iconoclast: A Neuroscientist Reveals How to Think Differently<&#47;a>. This book would be an excellent read at the pool on a holiday location, but at home it was nothing more than an entertaining read. Not really recommended.<&#47;p></p>
