<p>For my summer holidays i needed a book that was easy readable (size, weight, content) and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship&#47;dp&#47;0132350882">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship<&#47;a> was a perfect match for my reading sessions at the pool. Even better, i found inspiration to write cleaner (and thus better) code. This book is most certainly recommend!<&#47;p></p>
