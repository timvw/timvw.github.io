    My guess exactly, and Windows 7 may already be leading the way.

    Give every application it's own sandbox and life will be better.

    Tim,

    I've seen some wiki software do exactly that a few years ago. However, would every application need to have its own SQL Server installation?

    @Alex

    The scenarios i was thinking of where cases where one or more applications depend on eachother (eg: windows forms app that integrates with a particular version of ms-office) but haven't considered the data&#47;server part of such an application.

    I can only answer your question when i know whether we want different versions of the data existing next to each other.

<p>A couple of years ago, i think somewhere in 2003, i realised that hardware virtualisation was the way to go. Whenever i talked with people about distributing and deploying applications with a virtual machine image instead of a traditional installer they laughed at me (or atleast gave me a strange look of disbelief). The availability of multiple machines can be represented in a windowing environment through a metaphor of multiple desktops. Anyway, i'm still convinced that there will be a point in time where users have access to multiple applications that run in their own virtual machine. Time will tell.<&#47;p></p>
