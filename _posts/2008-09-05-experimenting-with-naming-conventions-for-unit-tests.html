<p>To be honest, i never really took the time to think about the names of my unit tests. Although i noticed posts like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;codebetter.com&#47;blogs&#47;david_laribee&#47;archive&#47;2007&#47;12&#47;17&#47;approaching-bdd.aspx">this one<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;elegantcode.com&#47;2008&#47;05&#47;01&#47;thanks-to-bdd&#47;">this one<&#47;a> they never inspired me to think about it. Earlier this week, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.goeleven.com">Yves Goeleven<&#47;a> demonstrated the power of using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Behavior_driven_development">BDD<&#47;a> inspired naming conventions and i was immediately sold. I applied the style on a couple of tests in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.codeplex.com&#47;BeTimvwFramework">BeTimvwFramework<&#47;a> and i must say that i like the resulting tests:<&#47;p><br />
