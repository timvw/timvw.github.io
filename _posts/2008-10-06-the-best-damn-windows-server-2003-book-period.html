<p>Last week i have read <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Windows-Server-Period-Computer-Security&#47;dp&#47;1931836124">The Best Damn Windows Server 2003 Book Period<&#47;a>. Although the book contains some interesting guidance i became annoyed with the fact that the book is overloaded with screenshots. Without those screenshots this book would contain around 250 interesting pages.<&#47;p></p>
