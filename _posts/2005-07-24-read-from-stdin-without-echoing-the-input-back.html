<p>Today i was looking for a way to read passwords from a PHP-CLI script. So it was important the password didn't appear on the console. I wrote a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.timvw.be&#47;wp-content&#47;code&#47;php&#47;ttyecho.php.txt">ttyecho function<&#47;a> that uses <a href="http:&#47;&#47;unixhelp.ed.ac.uk&#47;CGI&#47;man-cgi?stty">stty<&#47;a> to change the terminal line settings.<&#47;p></p>
