<blockquote>if you need typemock your design is wrong.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Although i understand what people are trying to say with that quote, it's wrong on many levels. I pretty much agree with everything that Roy wrote in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;weblogs.asp.net&#47;rosherove&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;11&#47;12&#47;test-driven-design-willed-vs-forced-designs.aspx">Test driven design &ndash; Willed vs. Forced Designs<&#47;a>. As some commenters pointed out it is hard to convince management that they need an isolation framework, let alone that they have to pay for one.<&#47;p></p>
<p>A couple of thoughts:<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>What about Pex Stubs & Moles? It uses the profiling API (less limitations than rhino&#47;moq&#47;...) too and for a lot of shops doing .Net development it's free.<&#47;li>
<li>I really don't understand people that are unwilling to pay for tools that can contribute to the generation of business value (eg: Resharper, NCover, NDepend, ...) when they don't come from Microsoft.<&#47;li>
<li>Filling up gaps in the .Net&#47;Microsoft space seems like an awful business model.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
