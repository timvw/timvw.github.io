<p>Earlier this month i have read <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft%C2%AE-NET-Architecting-Applications-PRO-Developer/dp/073562609X>Microsoft .NET: Architecting Applications for the Enterprise</a>. This time i was pretty pleased to notice that the author, <a href=http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/>Dino Esposito</a>, did not fill the book with references to other books written by him. All in all the book painted a pretty accurate picture of enterprise application development that is obviously inspired by masterworks like: <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201633612>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>, <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a> and <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>.</p>
<p>One remark though: I was a bit disappointed to see that the examples of unit tests used MSTEST. Why? Because it is such a broken product i find it hard to believe that for serious enterprise application development this library is actually usable.</p>
