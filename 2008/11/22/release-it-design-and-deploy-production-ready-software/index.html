<p>I really loved reading <a href=http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a> from The Pragmatic Programmers so when i noticed that a couple of bloggers were recommending <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Release-Production-Ready-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213>Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software</a> i decided to read it too. This book covers what happens to an application after it has been deployed in production. I really appreciated the first chapters with anti-patterns and patterns. At the end of the book the author also touches the problem of dependencies between machines and deployed applications and briefly offers a management solution under the name OpsDb. All in all, this book made me conscient about a set of problems i would not think about otherwise.</p>
