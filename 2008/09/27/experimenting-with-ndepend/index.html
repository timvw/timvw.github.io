				<p>Google Reader found 122 posts in my <a href="http://www.timvw.be/wp-links-opml.php">blogroll</a> about <a href="http://www.ndepend.com">NDepend</a> so i happily accepted the professional license which <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/">Patrick Smacchia</a> (thank you) offered me earlier this week. I quickly picked the assemblies from a project that has evolved over more than 5 years (.NET 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0) and the tool generated a screen loaded with data, but i found it difficult to extract any valuable information out of the statistics. Although i found zooming in the UI impressive, i was a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>Today i decided to start with something more sensible and created an NDepend project for the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BeTimvwFramework">BeTimvwFramework</a> solution. In order to add the code coverage results i first had to export them from visual studio. And then i let the analyzer do it&rsquo;s job. In the results of the default <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/CQL.htm">CQL</a> queries i found that the DateTimeHelper class was stateless, and thus could be turned into a static class. I also noticed the warning that the UnixEpoch field was public. After giving it a bit of thought i decided to leave the field public, but make it readonly. Although i have only used the tool for only an hour or so, it has already proven it&rsquo;s usefulness. More experimentation is definitely required.</p>
<p>I will finish with a couple of feature requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate the import of code coverage results generated by Visual Studio.</li>
<li>Use the default browser instead of launching Internet Explorer.</li>
</ul>
