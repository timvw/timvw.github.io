## Details

Currently this blog is using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static website which is then hosted on [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages),
using [actions-hugo](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo).


Find a nice theme, eg: https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink.git, and fork it. 
Now use the fork as your them:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/timvw/hugo-ink.git ./themes/ink
```
