Although i understand what people are trying to say with that quote, it’s wrong on many levels. I pretty much agree with everything that Roy wrote in Test driven design – Willed vs. Forced Designs. As some commenters pointed out it is hard to convince management that they need an isolation framework, let alone that they have to pay for one.

<p>if you need typemock your design is wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although i understand what people are trying to say with that quote, it&rsquo;s wrong on many levels. I pretty much agree with everything that Roy wrote in <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2009/11/12/test-driven-design-willed-vs-forced-designs.aspx">Test driven design – Willed vs. Forced Designs</a>. As some commenters pointed out it is hard to convince management that they need an isolation framework, let alone that they have to pay for one.</p>
<p>A couple of thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What about Pex Stubs &amp; Moles? It uses the profiling API (less limitations than rhino/moq/&hellip;) too and for a lot of shops doing .Net development it&rsquo;s free.</li>
<li>I really don&rsquo;t understand people that are unwilling to pay for tools that can contribute to the generation of business value (eg: Resharper, NCover, NDepend, &hellip;) when they don&rsquo;t come from Microsoft.</li>
<li>Filling up gaps in the .Net/Microsoft space seems like an awful business model.</li>
</ul>
